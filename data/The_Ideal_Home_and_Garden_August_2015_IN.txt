the Cook in Y ouThe Ideal Home and Garden August 2015  |  15 Last weekend, a dear friend invited us over to savour some of the wine 
she had procured from one of her recent trips abroad. As much as we loved the variety, another thing I noticed was how we had spent the greater part of the evening gathered around her open kitchen giggling, chatting and nibbling on the finger food. 
Once a self-sufficient corner, it is remarkable how the kitchen has come 
to emerge as THE most important social space in the house in recent times. And as industry experts would tell you, more and more people are opening up to the idea of turning their kitchens into a socially exciting space, and going going to great lengths to perfect the look. 
Our Kitchen Special comes at just the right time, backed with expert tips 
and suggestions on how you can make your kitchen the talking point of your home. From the latest trends, smart solutions, cool gadgets, a powerful shopping guide and more, use our issue as a guide‚Äîwhether it is about building a new kitchen or remodelling your old. 
My favourite is of course the Chef Special where we followed some of 
India‚Äôs most-loved chefs into their kitchens, and got them to rustle one favourite dish each, exclusively for you. The topping: some valuable kitchen advice from the masters. 
The next few pages are bound to help you emerge a lot more wiser when 
it comes to all things culinary. Get down to reading now!

Glass jars can be the simplest way to add an 
element of style to your kitchen. Th  e ones from

I have 
been an avid reader of TIHG over the years. And needless to say, I love the magazine and have used it as an inspiration for my home.
 I thought of sharing an image of my creations with TIHG readers. The ceramic Ô¨Ç  owers in the pictures have been made by me by hand, a skill I picked in Scotland. The ceramic bonsais are my own creation. In China and Japan, artiÔ¨Å  cial bonsais are small in size and the stem and branches are made up of either plastic or rubber with coloured glass pieces or semi-precious stones hanging. My bonsais on the other hand are completely made of ceramic with ceramic leaves and Ô¨Ç  owers and are eighteen to twenty inches high. Thank you TIHG for keeping the inspiration alive!

Though I do not belong to the creme de la creme of the 
society, I almost feel like one ever since I have started subscribing to TIHG. It feels like I have my personal interior decorator and advisor in your magazine. Features like ‚ÄòFashionable Living/ The Indian Touch/ Return of Burgundy‚Äô give out-of-the-box-ideas about furnishing and interiors. ‚ÄòThe Big Shopping Guide‚Äô, guides to what would suit best for my small paradise. What more can a middle class housewife ask from a periodical which deals with absolute perfect living.

I have a 3-BHK house, just below the terrace. 
Since the last two years, the concrete roof of the building terrace leaks during the monsoon, and water seeps into my master bedroom and other rooms spoiling the colours and the wall artifacts. The leak leaves behind moisture and moss. TIHG is a home-related magazine, and always come up with amazing solutions. Can you work it with an expert to get my problem solved. TIHG has now become a regular ‚Äòread‚Äô. WE simply LOVE it!

The special feature ‚ÄòBedroom Drama‚Äô 
in the July 2015 issue was really very informative. For a happy married life and for good marital relations, every woman and man needs some privacy in life. The accessories in the bedroom should be such that they should act as soothing colours to the eyes, same goes for colourful walls, curtains, furniture, etc. Soft and light colours like pink/ reddish pink do wonders for a successful marreid life.

Kitchens are no 
longer tucked-away 
spaces in a home with often minimal design intervention. To attain perfection with this space, it isn‚Äôt uncommon for renovators or home owners of newly-built spaces to knock down walls and much more in their quest for the ultimate space. Seamless design, attractive material and colours blended with good organisation for storage and its accessibility by using the right hardware makes for a perfect space. They must ideally bring out the beauty and functionality Shantanu GargAdd a little breathing space for yourself in 
the kitchen with colours that bring out a 
clean and spacious design. Interior designer 
Shantanu Garg tells you how colours can 
make an impact in your kitchen.

don‚Äôt overdo
simultaneously through a unique design. When it comes to kitchen colours, an amalgamation of base colours with contrasts is the latest trend. For instance: tJuxtaposing colours like turquoise, fuchsia, and mauve with earthy shades such as grey, mushroom, tan can look great. 
tTranscend the same palette to the display models to ensure every small detail is part of the whole. 
tWalls can be given a taupe tone making for a perfect backdrop lending warmth and a subtle aura to the entire space. 
tUsing high gloss lacquer paints help in adding colour to the kitchen, making it look clean and spacious.

Unarguably, one of the most 
recognised faces of Indian 
television, Chef Sanjeev Kapoor has been in people‚Äôs living rooms for more than two decades. Y et, he has a rather unusual pet peeve when it comes to modern Indian kitchens. ‚Äú Another thing that has gotten into our kitchens today is the amount of time that we spend socialising in there! Our hectic lives have made it almost compulsory to chit-chat while we are on-the-go in our kitchens! So, make sure to plan the seating accordingly in your ‚Äòopen kitchens‚Äô and ‚Äòeat on bars‚Äô with enough circulation space. Coordinate with the entire theme and the overall colours and make this area fun, ‚Äù he says. As for his favourite come-home meal? ‚ÄúMy eternal favourite is kadhi with steamed rice.

When not busy promoting regional Indian food across the globe, Chef Saransh enjoys being in charge of his own kitchen space. ‚ÄúBack home in Delhi, my mom is totally in charge of the kitchen. Even if I move a spice, it has to be with her permission, ‚Äù he tells. For his own, Saransh has opted for a L-shaped kitchen that is easy to arrange. And in place of cabinets on the wall parallel to the main cooking space, he has put up a big hanging hook bar for all major equipment. As for ingredients that you‚Äôll always find in his refrigerator, he says, ‚ÄúI am presently obsessed with eggs. ‚Äù YOU NEED:  
4 Eggs  
4 Cheese Slice  2 Buns  1 Tbsp Butter 1 no. Onions 1 no. Tomatoe Coriander leaves 20 gms chopped green chillies 2 nos chopped Oregano 2 tsp salt and pepper to taste 
METHOD:  
Slice the buns into halves and apply butter. 
Toast with the butter side on the tawa. Remove and keep aside. Finely chop the tomatoes, onions, chillies and coriander. Make single fried eggs. While the eggs are getting cooked, top with the chopped ingredients. Season with salt, pepper and oregano. Place a slice of cheese on each bun. Top this with a single fried egg. Now place this assembled dish in the pan (egg side on the top). Y ou can place 4 slices in one go. And cover the pan with the lid for steaming. The bottom side of the bun will cook and the cheese will melt with the heat. Serve these Kejriwals hot.Eggs Kejriwal

The Ideal Home and Garden August 2015  |  59 60  |  August 2015  The Ideal Home and GardenWhen I first built my kitchen 
studio, we had no blue 
prints or examples to work with. We built it from our dreams. Cosy faux wood floors, mood lighting, the best equipment. But it didn‚Äôt feel‚Ä¶ comfortable. Like a new pair of jeans that need an acid wash to feel lived in, I felt it needs more... more than the functional aspect of equipment etc. ‚Äù Rushina soon realised that for all the effort that we put into personalising the rest of the home, we rarely take the time to focus on decorating the kitchen! ‚ÄúWhy leave it to feel utilitarian, cool... sterile?

Impressions: Ruhi SinghConvenient Cooking
From a space to prepare 
meals, the kitchen 
has now emerged into a command centre. ‚ÄúToday, there is a requirement for kitchens, that do not just demonstrate visual appeal, but also revolutionary technology to ensure convenience. This goes a long way in providing an experience of convenient house chores, and most importantly does away  with the functional constraints encountered in traditional kitchen set-ups. Consumers are developing an inclination towards smart kitchen set-ups that integrate the best in functionality, colour, innovation, material and technology, ‚Äù  says home design consultant,  Dhaval Mistry.
It‚Äôs true that designing and 
maintaining the look of your kitchen is a precise art. The overall look should be stylish yet functional, some kind of an organised space for the entire family to come together. But, if you don‚Äôt have the time or budget for a major remodel, worry not. We have got some quick and easy decorating tips to update the look.  The best: These ideas will mix and match beautifully‚Äîuse one or  a few together.LIGHT BRIGHTIf the light in your kitchen is too dim and you are too bored with the fixtures, change it! Try overhead fixtures which are easier to fix and is not super expensive, either. ‚ÄúThe lights should not only be good designwise but must be functional. When it comes to Indian kitchens, the space and kind of cooking is very different. We need to choose fixture that gives a lot of light and is easy to clean, ‚Äù says Kunal Rohatgi, CEO, FOS Lighting. For a glamorous appeal, go for pendant lights, to be within budget, pick energy-saver lamps that give white light to your kitchen.
ADD ART
A piece of art in any form is a perfect way to liven up any space. So, why not the kitchen? Add an artwork that will glam up your cooking space or make you smile. The rule: fix it just above your upper cabinets or next to your kitchen with lesser grease spatter. If you have a light-coloured kitchen, go for brighter artworks and vice versa.

to your kitchen. To cut the daily cost, you can switch to artificial flowers that are easily available in different colours and types in the market. We recommend indoor herbs in small pots for garden enthusiasts. 
 HANDLE IT WELL
When was the last time you changed the drawers and handles of your kitchen? With a number of hardware brands in the Indian market, there are plenty of handles and knobs. We advise chromed finish straight line designs for a clean look. Also, changing the fittings and drawer liners will give you an opportunity to take out everything from the drawers and organise it in a better way.
REPLACE THE FAUCET
The most simple and straight-forward way to upgrade the look of your kitchen is to change the faucet. Though it can get little pricey, the replacement will be a worth. ‚ÄúConsumers these days, are fascinated with Italian designs. For kitchen faucets, apart from beautiful spout designs, the anti-splash property is very important. To combine the look, one can opt for ceramic sinks, ‚Äù says Parushini Aggarwal, Founder & Creative Director, Studio Creo.
GO FOR BUILT-IN
Kitchens today are slowly transforming into the new social space. Built-in kitchen appliances are designed to bring uniformity and an unobtrusive look to the homes. If you‚Äôve already zeroed in on a particular theme for other rooms, there is no reason why it can‚Äôt be extended to the kitchen. ‚Äú A wide variety of stylish built-in kitchen appliances can become the focal point of homes, if organised systematically. With a wide range of products like cooking hobs, hoods, ovens, combi microwave-ovens, dishwashers, coffee machines and refrigerators not only blend-in perfectly with the rest of the home with their neat and clean design; but also offer the best in-class features, ‚Äù shares Bhavya Shah, BSH Household Appliances Manufacturing Pvt.
BRIGHTEN THE SP ACE
Simply changing the tiles of the walls can change the look and feel of your kitchen. The enhancement that tiles can offer to the spaces is no secret. With the seemingly unlimited tile lines available today, there is a product which meets each individual‚Äôs design style. ‚ÄúDecor tiles behind a shelf or on a side wall in kitchen can accentuate its appearance. Tile backsplash add depth and life to the space by providing bold lines which can‚Äôt go unnoticed, ‚Äù shares Ashok Goyal, CEO, Nitco.

Sanvari Alagh Nair, is the director of HouseProud.in, and has headed creative production of several hit TV shows like Nach Baliye, Oye its Friday and Zor Ka Jhatka.ON BRIGHTENING UP A 
KITCHEN
QOurs is a parallel kitchen in 
a recently-purchased 2BHK. 
One end opens to the living room (and closed off by means of a sliding door) with a small window on the other side. The cabinets and countertops are in good shape though they are almost 10 years old, with a mix of laminate and granite used. Even the floor is dark brown in colour. I‚Äôd like to lighten up the space by replacing the cabinets. Please advise on suitable, bright colours for these and for countertops too. Padma Sundari, Mumbai
Y ou can go with cool colours for cabinets like light teal, duck egg green, olive pastel or choose  from a selection of new lightwood laminate shades. I think a distress white finish laminate will look beautiful too if you don‚Äôt like  stark whites. It will add texture to the space without compromising on brightness. Keep the counter top a light grey, or white marble/granite with grey undertones. This helps maintain cleanliness in the kitchen, as drops and spills are easily visible.Y ou can experiment with these colours for the dado, or you can work the dado with a simple rectangular white tile,  set in a traditional brickwork pattern.  This will add a rustic design element while having a clean and sleek look. Keeping it simple and fuss-free on the basic layout increases your options of colouring your kitchen with beautiful accessories

TURNING THE KITCHEN 
INTO A SOCIAL/EAT-IN AREA
QWe have a decent 
kitchen size with one 
section meant for dining and a cooking zone adjacent to this. They are separated by a passageway that leads to the living/family room (no dining table here as we use the kitchen as an eat-in area). I love to decorate and want to revamp the dining area. Any suggestions for furniture and wall colour?Reena Mathias, PuneI would suggest a shelf counter on the wall of the dining area‚Äîthis needn‚Äôt be more than 15-18 inches in depth and can be to the centre of the wall. This serves beautifully as a buffet  counter when you have  guests over and otherwise can be accessorised with photographs, decor and  more when not in use.
Wallpaper is a great idea 
‚Äîchoose something with light undertones to bring out the brightness quotient. A textured wallpaper adds a stronger design element. For the dining table, go for a rectangular six-seater as it increases the space for dining and serving. Choose a modern, simple design with straight legs to keep it looking large. Pick an accent colour from the wallpaper to upholster your dining chairs. This will complete the look. Add a runner to the dining table for a striking finish.  
USING EVERDAY 
KITCHEN ITEMS AS DECOR
QThis column is full of 
great ideas for making 
the home cosy and fresh. Can you share some  on using regular things like old cups, baking trays, plates as decor. I love to do up my home, and think this is an inexpensive, yet a brillant way to make it look beautiful. Neha Khan, HyderabadIt is absolutely great to hear about your enthusiasm for design! Paint old baking trays in any colour you like (darker hides stains) and use them as plant trays for the window sill or terrace. Get your hands on white sand, add it to the tray along with some coloured glass stones to get a gorgeous texture. Club small potted plants together (herbs, cacti, etc) and place on these trays to give them a fresh look. In fact, you can use old cups as mini planters too! These are great for every day herbs  -- just ensure that you continuously trim them so it doesn‚Äôt get too big for its new ‚Äòplanter‚Äô! Quarter plates and saucers make for excellent candle holders‚Äîplace a medium pillar candle in the centre of the saucer and you have a vintage style candle holder! An added bonus‚Äîthey keep the wax off any wooden surface.

INSPIRED LIVING
The collage of finishes, textures, lighting and furniture throughout the house is breathtaking for its sophistication and style. The Kenia house is an inspiration, an institution within itself for guests and relatives on how the modern and the traditional can live in peace and harmony under one roof. It is a home that gives an identity to the owners. While the house was being designed, Nimish had three things very clearly etched in his mind ‚Äì the house must have a wow factor, should be able to fulfill the basic needs of three generations living under one roof, and should  have an appeal of an artistic, poetic and experimental philosophy without going overboard. And all the mentioned elements are brought out in each part of the space with interesting ceilings, abstract lighting, art-works, inclined library, zen meditation area and the luxurious home theatre. 106   |  August 2015  The Ideal Home and GardenMountain Retreat

From ‚Äòsmart cities‚Äô to 
‚Äòresilient cities‚Äô , the 
realty market world over is consumed with investing and building full-integrated and self-sustained urban townships as a means to draw further financial investment to the housing sector. So what will these cities of the future look like? Bhartiya Urban is developing Bhartiya City in Bengaluru, a 125-acre integrated urban township within the municipal limit of Bengaluru City, and strategically located near Hebbal halfway between the international airport and  MG Road. This 20 million sq. ft. development is planned as a self-contained city with housing in various formats, including both mass housing and branded luxury residences, retail (souks, high-street retail and shopping malls), five star hotels, business/financial district, IT campus, convention/conference centre and other amenities to serve the community. The highlight of the public realm, planned by six teams of international and local architects over six years, will be a seven acre central park, which will be home to  a centre for Performing Arts. 
Furthermore, Bhartiya City 
points the way forward as the city of the future, as the development is presented as An extensive range of developments, world-class amenities along with  
a nurturing and uplifting environment combine to make Bhartiya City in Bengaluru 
an urban Mecca for exceptional living.

not just a smart city but there 
is an intense obsession by the city‚Äôs planners and builders over the city‚Äôs soul, with an aim to offer spaces where residents can interact with the community and the environment. Presented as the ‚ÄòCity of Joy‚Äô , the township contains well-landscaped green lanes, waterfronts and parks. This also means greater attention has been given to finer details in building the city, including curbstones that are cut identical to each other, furniture handcrafted in Italy, street-lights that multi-task as surveillance cameras and Wi-Fi ports, an outdoor deck that can seats at least four and access to public spaces like link gardens and a clubhouse for homes in the mass housing districts. 114   |  August 2015  The Ideal Home and GardenNouveau ArrivalThe Ideal Home and Garden August 2015  |  115  Nouveau Arrival

Young architects Cyrus Patell 
and Eliza Higgins founded 
CollectiveProject in Bengaluru in late 2013 after moving from New Y ork to set up their own practice. For their first project, the brief given was completely open, though it was understood that it would primarily be a landscape proposal. The result was not just an incredible learning experience for the partners but also a space that lends a private and secluded retreat from daily life through acoustic separation and visual privacy from the neighbouring city.
This project transforms an unused

122   |  August 2015  The Ideal Home and GardenIn Bengaluru lies Garden in a Pavilion by CollectiveProject that is  
composed of local black granite and simple strips of wood yet offers a  
luxurious retreat through a conceptual and detail driven design.

garden and personal library. The pavilion was conceptualised as an inhabitable piece of furniture bridging a lush and naturalistic landscape. Accessed by a separate entrance from the street, the existing ground plane was excavated to create a sunken path lined in local black granite, with shift in levels combined with dense planting. Although physically separated from the client‚Äôs residence by a masonry wall, strategically placed openings allow for glimpses into the garden beyond. The structure, clad in thin strips of locally reclaimed wood, acts as a portal framing two contrasting scenarios, a dense ‚Äòwild‚Äô garden and a grass amphitheater/ seating area. On special occasions, the seating can be cleared to create a small covered stage for family performances. Small niches line the walkway and are illuminated by diyas in the evening.
Eliza says, ‚ÄúThe major challenge we faced 
was maintaining a high quality of craftsmanship and precision during construction. Given the simplicity of form and delicacy of the materials (long 2‚Äù strips of wood), consistency and alignment were incredibly important. We spent many hours on site monitoring progress and making adjustments to ensure crisp edges and an even finish. ‚Äù
The design process was enhanced by a 
constant dialogue with the client so the final product is a unique space that is very specific to him. ‚ÄúPavilion in a Garden laid the foundation for the belief in the success that can come from a Green HouseGreen House
124   |  August 2015  The Ideal Home and Gardenstrong collaboration between architect 
and the client. It was truly a pleasure working on this project and has set the standard for the dialogue we strive to maintain in all of our work, ‚Äù she says.
From furniture and interiors to 
institutional buildings and residential such as this one, the studio‚Äôs investigations are design driven and occur at multiple scales. Eliza explains further, ‚ÄúWe consider the entire architectural experience‚Äîcombining spatial narratives, landscape and materials. Our approach is open and fluid‚Äîdrawing inspiration from site, culture, environment and technology. Our work is both detail and conceptually driven. ‚Äù
Presently, they are working on a few 
other private residences where the landscape is an incredibly important component of the design.‚ÄúWe feel that landscape design is an intrinsically linked extension of the built environment and must be evaluated as part of the complete proposal and not independently. In no way do we claim to be landscape architects but we try to incorporate as much of the site design into our proposals as possible. ‚Äù
