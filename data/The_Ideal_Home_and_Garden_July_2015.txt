FURNISHED ROOM 
An All-Inclusive Guide to Furniture & Furnishing ShoppingTHE The Ideal Home and Garden July 2015  |  17 The season to sip on hot chai accompanied with crisp pakoda s are here. 
Where we are, in Mumbai, it has been pouring non-stop over the last 
few days. 
And barring the hazardous commute to work, I am perpetually perched 
on my comfy couch watching the clouds gather and the big fat droplets of rain drench my balcony full of greens on a non-stop basis. 
If it weren’t for my couch and the cosy tea corner I have created for 
myself, I am not sure my rain experience would have turned out so delightful.  Exactly why we have come up with a Furniture & Furnishings Special. According to me, these two elements can determine the way you want your house to look.  
The festive months are not too far away, and this is just the right time 
to start planning your big buys for the festive makeover. Refer to our extensive all-encompassing shopping guide for what to buy and where to get them, spread across the magazine. We have also picked some of our favourite pieces and set it up for you for some style inspiration. What’s more, there is a complete expert-backed trend guide to assist you with investing in the right things. 
As always, your stylish home makeover starts here, keep reading!

The June issue of The Ideal Home and 
Garden is indeed a collector’s delight. Never before has Indian decor been so vibrant and happening, and this issue captures all the elements so well with in-depth articles, useful snippets on where to get what, and eye-candy pictures. Of special mention is the cover focus on Sussanne Khan who is making bold strides in the world of decor with her unique ideas and statement pieces. Her candid views on the changing decor landscape made for an interesting read. The ‘green’ shopping guide, the article on ‘Art Investment’, and recipes of local cuisine were compelling too. Kudos to the team for putting together this quintessentially Indian theme. Go green, go Indian!

Write 
to us..Access to Knowledge 
An interior and home décor magazine is not only about homes and 
interiors, I believe. It’s also about architects and interior designers. As a student of architecture, I am keen on seeing articles and drawings by top notch designers. A proﬁ  le is more apt, as it will provide details and information to students who aspire to become top professionals some day. A lot of rich information about homes, gardens, garden landscaping can be shared by these professionals. Also, tips and ideas on how to spruce up your homes are their specialty. Our country has talent in abundance. So, please make a beginning and take the opportunity to tap this beautiful resource to enrich the knowledge of your beloved readers.

Woman Power
It is never easy being the wife of a superstar, but 
Gauri Khan is a rare exception. Her new workspace talks volumes about her design, style and artistic sense. Being the woman behind Shah Rukh Khan’s success story, she certainly has not lost her own identity. In fact, she is growing to be a big name in Mumbai’s art and design space. While I always conﬁ  ned ethnicity to clothes, your superb ideas on how to display ethnicity even in homeware made me change my mind for good. 
Srinath H. R., Bangalore All inOne
I must say that every month TIHG 
increases the net worth of my humble apartment by merely resting on my coffee table. The June 2015 issue was no different when it brought famous celebrities like Sussanne Khan, Gauri Khan, and Adarsh Gill on a single platform. Iconic inspirations about Gauri’s work space, curious information about Sussane’s YOO, and the signature silver of Adarsh Gill’s collection virtually infuses an elevating feeling. I genuinely believe that class doesn’t lie in one’s money chest,  aesthetics and taste does. And TIHG knows it better!

If you are an eco-warrior 
at heart and want to really 
make a difference, here’s a big green idea for you, friends or home. Mumbai start-up and greeting card company, 21fools successfully introduced a product known as seed paper, from which their cards are made. These moistened sheets, when potted and watered, as you would for any other green pots about the home, will bloom into a gorgeous plant. Now Founder Fool & CEO Divyanshu Asopa has extended the product range to include coasters, bookmarks, door hangers, promotional material, gifts packaging, stationery. A good response has also led to them taking on bulk orders from large scale organizations and corporate companies. As for the price range, it may vary, depending on the number of colours used in printing and the quantity placed. For more details, visit www.21fools.com.

Created by acclaimed 
Indian designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Cinema Suite in Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences, London  is inspired most notably by 1940s and 1950s Hollywood as well as the Indian Cinema era of the 1950s. Guests will find reference to masters such as Satyajit Ray, Francis Ford Coppola and Bergman in the imposing study, world cinema leaders like Majidi, Wong Kar-Wai and Almodovar amongst the cultured kitch of the living room and echoes of The Stepford Wives in the kitchen.  They will sense the golden Hollywood era of Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe in one bedroom whilst the other draws on colonial inspiration and renowned Indian artists such as Guru Dutt, Merchant Ivory and Bimal Roy. From the leather chesterfield to precious glassware, intriguing art and antique rugs, world arts and crafts are displayed throughout. Each wall is a work of art in itself, with striking Nina Campbell wallpapers in burnt orange, black and red, laden with curios collected from over 32 different cultures.

The Felt Peacock Chair
by Dror Bershetrit 
uses folding as the primary construction method. His work focuses primarily on bringing poetry to the necessary functionality of materials, drawing from a sophisticated artistic sensibility and extensive experience in industrial engineering. The chair features three layers of felt that are precisely folded on 
to a simple metal frame.
Easy to transport and
store when not in 
use, the Stitch Chair by Adam Goodrum, is a colourful statement piece that includes swatches of red, black, yellow, blue and grey. Manufactured with an aluminum plate; the chair is lacquered with glossy finish for extra shine.  Statement Seating 
Comfort and style come together beautifully in these modern chairs crafted 
by design masters from around the world.

The Layers Cloud Chair by Richard Hutten shows 
off the beautiful colours and was inspired by the 
painted desert in Arizona. As a child, Richard dreamed about lying on a cloud. He wanted his piece to be about colours and tactility. Almost 100 colours were used to design the chair. Due to the nature of the fabric, the lower part of the chair is looser, with a compact and solid top. Each layer of the chair was drawn separately, the colours carefully selected, individually cut and applied by hand. Jasper Morrison’s Thinking Man’s Chair was first presented by Zeev Aram in 
1987, where it was spotted by Giulio Cappellini, who agreed to manufacture it. An easy chair in lacquered metal, with a frame in tube section, seat and back in flat bars. Armrests are fitted with flat drinks holders. Available in green, dark grey, terracotta and gypsum white colours.Cappellini92  |  July 2015   The Ideal Home and GardenFeature
The Pink Chair was 
created in 2003 by 
Vladimir Tsesler when he saw a girl sitting on a chair and thought it looked like a single form. After much experimentation with the kind of material, the designer decided to stick to polyester resin and acrylic.The chair started as a doodle of squares within squares and the concept of a ‘chair within a chair’ 
like the popular movie Inception  about a dream within 
a dream. The Inception Chair by Vivian Chiul was  a light-hearted idea that became a design challenge. The designer wanted to make a chair that was both sculptural and functional, so the idea of being able to take it apart was developed.
London-based industrial designers Nipa Doshi and Jonathan Levien designed an armchair with a slender yet enveloping form called 
CAPO. The designers got the idea for shape and materiality from the image of a dapper gentleman with a well-cut suit and a felted hat.As the name suggests, CAPO with its wide cantilevered arms and upturned lapel, transforms the sitter into a boss.

The Magica Chair by Italian designer Davide Conti seems to only stand 
on one foot. This optical illusion is made possible with transparent 
material used to maintain the balance. The chair is very durable and strong, and is a perfect piece to have around.This lightweight Knotted Chair by Marcel Wanders combines industrial 
techniques and handcrafting. A thread constructed of aramid and carbon fibres, is knotted into the shape of a chair and then impregnated with epoxy resin and hung in a frame to dry, leaving the final form in the hands of gravity.

The newly-opened Nivasa store at MG Road in the capital is an 
extension of the brand’s offerings of art rolled into furniture.

After the success of the first 
flagship store at Delhi’s 
plush Meherchand Market, Nivasa, has now come up with a second outlet at the capital’s furniture hub, MG Road. A design company founded by principle designer, Rohit Kapoor, each piece from Nivasa is designed to complement the space it belongs to. The entire range of Nivasa includes anything and everything that a home needs in terms of furniture. Since the idea is to provide complete interior solutions, Nivasa also retails lights, accessories and 4,000 varieties of furnishings. The Ideal Home and Garden July 2015|  97 The IT Store
Nivasa is the brainchild of Rohit 
Kapoor, a chartered accountant by qualification, who got into the field of designing in the year 1993 with a friend. The self-taught Rohit believes in Kaizan that is constant incremental improvement. Be it furniture, design, texture or colours; this philosophy reflects evidently at the brand’s collection. 
Talking about his brand, Rohit 
shares, “We are a simple brand but high on integrity. I always want my brand to reflect the people behind it. The aim is to achieve perfection and the only way is when my creation reflects exactly who I am. I don’t want to mislead my customers. Therefore, we try to be authentic in every aspect of design detail. ”98  |  July 2015   The Ideal Home and GardenThe IT Store
Rohit feels that the field of 
design has evolved so wide that he doesn’t keep creativity restricted to the four walls. “My design sensibilities have been evolved through travelling. I am very passionate about Spanish designs. I am also fascinated by French and Mediterranean designs, ” shares Rohit.
The uniqueness of the 
brand Nivasa lies in the fact that every customer is attended to by a designer and not a sales person. “For me, designing and selling furniture is not enough. Y ou should give a personal touch to every customer entering the brand, ” says Rohit.He further adds, “The motto is to change the rules of the game. I want to change the perception people have for furniture and design. I want to redefine the Indian market and bring in a new perception about Indian designs. ”The Ideal Home and Garden July 2015|  99 The IT Store

furniture is not enough. You should give a personal touch to every customer entering the brand”.

With an established 
presence at design 
festivals such as London’s Alchemy Festival, Frankfurt’s Ambiente, and Milan Design Week, to name a few, Sahil Bagga and Sarthak Sengupta are distinctly part of the young design mavericks’ cool crowd. The design ethos followed at their young and flourishing firm, Sahil & Sarthak Design Co. is to juxtapose something which is mundane with something else that can be contemporary and innovative.  The duo also strongly maintain an inclination towards Indian art and craft. “We have tried to revive, re-contextualise and re-interpret objects that have become obsolete, which don’t have any place in our daily life but we have seen them while growing up, ” says Sarthak. In their work process, the designers try to imbibe two aspects—first, sustainability wherein the products should not only be eco-friendly, but also culturally and socially sustainable. Second, the products should have an element of fun and quirk.
This Delhi-based firm 
believes in the concept of ‘Zero Kilometer Design’ , as seen at the much-talked boutique property, Lakshman Sagar in Rajasthan. “ All elements are

How Sahil Bagga and Sarthak Sengupta met the buzzy design scene  
with innovative yet sustainable design solutions for spaces and more.

inspired locally, sourced locally 
and fabricated by local artisans. Th e objective was to identify 
and source various skills, craft  s 
and materials around that region that could be improvised and reinterpreted, ” shares Sahil. Th ey are currently designing 
two other boutique resorts at Jim Corbett Forest Reserve  and the Andaman Islands.
Speaking about inspiration, 
Sarthak says,“We take inspiration from a wide range of products. Like, a craft   that 
is losing its value and is not practiced regularly but has a story of its own. Majorly, Indian craft  s have a context 
in a way that they are either connected to tradition or religious rituals like weddings, etc. ”  His partner further tells us that they also draw inspiration from the costumes of Kathakali and Th  heyyam dance. “Th  e 
inspiration can be as simple as an object that has no value but has an interesting appeal, ” says Sahil. Having worked with a number of materials, a favourite for them is the Katran collection.  “We wanted to create a pragmatic and sustainable system right from the village and town to big cities, ” shares Sahil. It has received an overwhelming response in India and abroad, and has also been selected for showcase at various international platforms such as Victoria & Albert Museum, London for the India Now show.
What’s really fascinating is 
the design philosophy behind Sahil and Sarthak’s creations that is based on ethics, ethnic and ecology. “It is important to have the right ethics to have a successful brand. Every new project requires collaboration with new craft  smen, vendors 
and uniquely skilled people- and we try to follow the same concept of ethics for everyone, ” explains Sahil.
With an eye on the future, 
Sarthak concludes, “India is full of materials, ideas, craft  s 
and techniques that allow one to explore widely. As a brand, we are continuously evolving by adding new products in diff erent categories. ”102   |  July 2015   The Ideal Home and GardenArtist-Speak
Artists are a 
different league 
altogether. They use different spectrums and media in their work to showcase the cycle of life. Dhiren Kumar Saha is one such artist. But his medium is surprisingly different. His paintings talk about ‘success’ and ‘failure’ in life. And as subject, he chooses ‘ups’ and ‘downs’ from his own personal life. His paintings more or less depict learning experiences of life. The elements in his paintings appear as cosmological objects. It talks about shedding away all bondages of life and every violation of human rights in our country. At times his paintings reflect the positives in sporting failures and politics. Almost all his paintings end with a slogan  — Never Give Up. Dhiren says, “I draw inspiration from my subconscious mind. And they keep happening frequently” . He never draws sorrows, only dynamism, which inspire to face challenges head-on and move on. As a strong medium to pass on a message, he uses  acrylic on canvas for all his paintings. He ends on a high, “Through my paintings as an artist, I can convey my anger, sorrow, frustrations, give a message, which may otherwise  become difficult. A painting never dilutes, it talks straight” .

for their home in Mumbai, the ranch style home decor can be seen amply across the spaces— not only in charming knick knacks and curios but also as part of the design scheme, from deliberately done, undulating and neutral- paletted walls to stout wooden beams and wood flooring. These elements combine to lend the spaces a pleasant, lived-in appeal with nearly every corner, particularly in the living room, inviting you to take a seat and simply unwind over a hot of cup of chai and delicious The Ideal Home and Garden July 2015  |  107  Ideal Living
snacks,  much like the gracious 
hospitality we met with when visiting this home.
Layoutwise, the modest 2-BHK 
residence has sections that flow well into each other—a cosily done-up lobby area leading to the study room on the right and the kitchen on the left. This opens into the living room that covers  most of the apartment, and which has been visually segregated into a semi-formal and informal seating area, with the latter positioned on a raised platform and set up as a cozy alcove. At the other end lies the two, simply done bedrooms occupied by the couple and his mother respectively. 
This home is truly inspiring  
for the neatly done and thoughtful touches by a  couple who seemingly don’t spend a lot of time at home,  and yet have made one that is filled with light, charm and simple luxury.  108   |  July 2015   The Ideal Home and GardenSublime Luxury

the rains is on your mind, 
head over to Vasundhara Sarovar Premier, a five-star resort where you will have the backwaters virtually kissing your palms. Strategically located at a distance of  around 63 kms from the Nedumbassery International Airport, Kochi, Vasundhara will woo you with a plethora of activity—be it sightseeing, shopping, nature or adventure. Putting up at Vasundhara is a sublime engagement with natural surroundings and coconut palms all around. When at the resort, live and explore the culture of Kerala not only through the authentic cuisines, but also by experiencing the state’s folklore and art. Feel indulged with beautifully appointed rooms, bathrooms, and a glorious view of the waterfront. 
A spectacular view of the backwaters at a distance 
through the spacious lobby done up in traditional Kerala style with mural paintings and silver headgear of elephants suggest you are being welcomed into the midst of a typical Kerala temple festival. Most of the rooms of the two-storeyed main building of the resort offer a view of the backwaters, while the ,GHDO*HWDZD\V110   |  July 2015   The Ideal Home and Gardenfloating cottages and heritage 
villas open to the lawns or the swimming pool.
LIVE IT UP
Staying at the floating cottage is perhaps what makes the Vasundhara experience different. The rooms are spacious, the bathrooms clean and they come with a private jacuzzi overlooking the backwaters. These cottages and heritage villas are much sought-after round the year for their ambience. 
The heritage villas are 200- 
year-old structures, that have been transported and placed exactly as they were originally. Cosmetic touches like ,GHDO*HWDZD\V,GHDO*HWDZD\V
placing handmade tiles from 
Athangudi for the flooring gives it the ethnic touch.

would be on facilitating wealth creation through an industrial set-up, which in turn will generate revenue, export, and employment. Living : Once a mass of 
industries commercial catchment is ready at MWC, the focus would be on enhancing the ‘living’ namely: developing residential and social infrastructures.Life: Once livelihood and

124   |  July 2015   The Ideal Home and GardenCafé Nemo is a modern 
all -day restaurant, with 
multiple spaces that flow seamlessly in an almost storylike manner —an elegantly  lit bar area with folding tables, two dining rooms, and a private event area. This 4,500 sq. ft. bungalow in Worli village in Mumbai has been transformed by Busride Studio into an offb  eat space 
with a modern minimal vibe that creates an understated style statement with a strong signature attitude.
The gallery -like whimsical 
space comes alive when the black and white illustrated maps adorn some of the surfaces, and the incomplete frameworks allow a constantcreative expression to flow from the plate onto the walls. With wall installations that keep changing, high ceilings, a section with pretty hand mirrors and flooring resembling a chessboard, the minimalist but refined interiors spell quirky elegance.
Talking about the restaurant 
name and dining experience, partners Anup Gandhi, Nevil Timbadia and Sahil Timbadia inform that it is derived from the book ‘Story Quirky Elegance

the protagonist of the book, the partners set out on a voyage of discovery and have created a place with cuisine and drinks inspired by travel and produce. A dining experience that can be defined by taste not type, they have transformed the loud, grungy erstwhile space into a calmer, non fussy  Cafe Nemo. “We just like the name Nemo, it’s simple and non trendy. Also, we are located in a village by the sea in Mumbai, so it’s kind of hidden and you will have to ‘Find Nemo’ . We serve our version of cafe fare influenced by our travels around the world and with an aversion to typical cafe fare found in Mumbai. While the cuisine is agnostic, we are biased with Asian flavours and this is evident in our menu items. ” The new trendy space is  a complete package, which the team has tried to create.  The agnostic yet bold flavours  of food are complemented by a full service bar and locally brewed craft beer on tap. In addition, Nemo’s Party Cabin is a great space for festive banquets and a great intimate space for the music and the performing arts. Designwise, colours are  a common thread that connects the menu and décor—colourful agnostic delicacies with Asian influences and monochrome interiors. Besides, the contrast of the age old bungalow walls and high ceilings with the modern minimalistic walls on the opposite side are a remnant of another age and time in Mumbai.Green House
