HOME COMMUNITYMy to-do list
for January
The things I‚Äôll be planning, doing 
and shopping for this month
This Christmas, I‚Äôll be taking a
less-is-more approach, planningsome perfect downtime and
challenging my family to a board gamefest they‚Äôll never forget.SLOWING DOWN I‚Äôm pouring my
ph
ysical and mental resources into the
run-up, so I can do as little as possiblewhen the holidays actually arrive. I haveplans for extreme indolence involving (in this order): my M&S cashmerejoggers; my parents‚Äô squashiest sofa; aMiss Marple box set (Joan Hickson, of
course); lots of cheese. Weight Watchersis on hold until 1 January!
UNPLUGGING Richmond Chri
 stmases
do tend to be a bit telly-centric. I don‚Äôt
actually have a problem with that ‚Äì I‚Äômemotionally attached to Marple, the littlestRichmonds have an annual date withThe Muppets Christmas Carol and Ma
Richmond will be borderline cantankerousi fs h em i s s e st h eStrictly Christmas spesh.
But the dining table‚Äôs going to do doubleduty this year as a jigsaw and board gamestation, so we can actually engage witheach other face to face. I know the kids willlove some sustained time with the biggestRichmonds, who must seem to be eitheralways working or glued to their phones.
APPRECIATING THE LITTLE THINGS
I walked into my parents‚Äô living roomr
ecently to Ô¨Ånd my creaky old Pa
kneeling at the foot of a little Richmond,diligently Ô¨Åling her verruca (apologies if you‚Äôre eating). Watchinghim peer through hisbifocals at the offendingfungus, I felt a sudden rushof love for Pa and his quiet heroism. The child inquestion was absorbed inOctonauts and therefore
oblivious to the pathos ofthe moment, and it struck mehow many small acts of loveby the parents Richmondmy sister and I must havemissed or forgotten over the years.They‚Äôre not big on displays of affection,b u tt h i sC h r i s t m a s ,M aa n dP aw i l lb eexperiencing some serious payback.SCALING BACK Every year I feel a
bit
guilty about th e excess ‚Äì my over-
shopping for gifts and panic-buyingfood nobody will eat. I do it out of fearof disappointing someone ‚Äì will thisbe the year they‚Äôll actually want to eatthe Christmas cake and boxes of dates?
I‚Äôm going to try a quality-not-quantityapproach this year and give the stuffwe don‚Äôt really need to the food bank‚Äì Ô¨Ånd your nearest at trusselltrust.org.

Antiqued glass
Vintage-style mirrors have gone rough-luxeTHE NEXT BIG THING
T H ES T O R YS OF A R Aged glass may
b
ring to mind grand old palaces, but the
antiqued-mirror finish is having a modern
makeover. Shaking off its shabby-chicpersona, this mottled effect gives a rough-luxe look to walls and alcoves, especiallywhen used with industrial-style furniture.
WHERE WE‚ÄôVE SEEN IT Whether it‚Äôs
us
ed for tiles, panels or wallpaper, this
trend is taking a hold on walls. Evoking
faded grandeur is Cole & Son‚Äôs King‚ÄôsMirror wallpaper ‚Äì inspired by baroquequarters of Hampton Court Palace ‚Äì andHarlequin‚Äôs crackle-effect wallcovering,Eglomise. Bespoke companies, such asRupert Bevan, Rough Old Glass, Cl√©and Glassology, create varied finishes onantiqued-glass panels, tiles and kitchensplashbacks. Andrew Martin combines thetrend with his signature industrial style inVictor ‚Äì a glass-topped metal coffee table.

THE MAN BEHIND THE LOOK
Born and brought up in a rural part
of
Johannesburg, South Africa, with
his Portuguese mother, Hungarianfather and three elder sisters, Craig‚Äôslove of gardening and the greatoutdoors started at an early age.‚ÄòWe kept our own ducks, geese andchickens, and grew all our ownvegetables, including some exoticingredients for South Africa, suchas paprika, kohlrabi and aubergines,‚Äôsays Craig. ‚ÄòAs a child, I used to
enjoy gardening with my mum,and my love of good food stemsFORWHERETOBUYITEMSSHOWN, TURN TO OUR SHOPPING DIRECTORYHIGH STREET

Meet the man responsible for turning Dobbies
into an inspiring winter wonderland at ChristmasCraig Roman
from my parents, too. Because of theirbackgrounds, I‚Äôd go to school withunusual ingredients in my lunchbox,such as rye bread and cured hams. We are deÔ¨Ånitely a family of foodies.‚Äô
A childhood interest in art and
dancing led Craig into studying  Ô¨Åne arts and different forms of  dance before he started his career infashion retail. ‚ÄòI used to work inStuttafords department store in SouthAfrica, which is where I met Liz Muller,who is now the global creative directorof Starbucks,‚Äô explains Craig. ‚ÄòShe wasmy Ô¨Årst visual-merchandising boss SHOP FLOOR

ANUARY 2016  housetohome.co.uk/idealhomemagazinewho showed me that anything and
everything is possible with hardwork and conviction.‚Äô 
Craig worked his way up in
retail to become the head ofvisual merchandising at Edgars,South Africa‚Äôs biggest and bestdepartment store. ‚ÄòI‚Äôd reached thetop of my game in South Africa,so I decided to come to Englandto work and started all over againfrom grass-roots level on the shopfloor as a visual merchandiser,‚Äôhe says. ‚ÄòAfter an initial stint at
Dobbies, I then spent five years at W yevale 
Garden Centres, but came back to Dobbiesin 2012. The highlightof my career to date  is heading up visualmerchandising for  the best garden and home centres in the UK. I‚Äôm very proud  to work here.‚Äô
HOME FOR CHRISTMAS
Craig now lives in a little village in
F
ife with his partner Adam, who works
in the restaurant industry. ‚ÄòOur houseis an eclectic mix of old and new, witha good twist of African antiquity andinjections of gardenalia ‚Äì I haveat least 30 treasured house plants,and my garden changes seasonallywith my moods,‚Äô he says. It is wherethe couple will be spending Christmasthis year with friends and family fromboth London and South Africa. ‚ÄòI loveChristmas,‚Äô says Craig. ‚ÄòWe alwaysh a v ear e a lt r e ei nt h eh o u s ea n dhang up stockings on Christmas Eve.I make our st ockings from scratch
each year and Ô¨Åll them withpersonalised surprises. Being a foodie,I can‚Äôt resist reinventing the traditionalChristmas meal. Last year, I did threeravioli baubles ‚Äì one golden orb
stuffed with tenderturkey smotheredwith a bread and buttersauce, a red one stuffedwith cranberries, redonion and parsnips,and a green one fora starter that wasfilled with Brusselssprouts, parmesanand smoked bacon.‚Äô

You need to be quick to find a
great property, but Jeltje Smitliterally ran to find her perfectfamily home in Abcoude inHolland. ‚ÄòIt was Christmas2012 and I was jogging by the
dike when I saw this house for sale,‚Äô she says.‚ÄòAt the time, my husband Erik and I were livingin a converted windmill on the other side ofthe village. It had been in our family for 45years ‚Äì my parents lived there, then my brother,and Erik and I had been there for five years.
‚ÄòThe windmill was lovely, but it was small
and impractical, with crooked walls and narrowstairs. We wanted to start a family, so neededsomething larger ‚Äì and that‚Äôs when I saw thisplace. We weren‚Äôt the only ones keen to buy

The previous owner was an elderly lady. ‚ÄòShe
was remarkable ‚Äì she was 104 and still climbedthe stairs to her bedroom every night,‚Äô saysJeltje. ‚ÄòBut the 19th-century property wasn‚Äôtinsulated and its roof beams and floorboardswere rotten and needed to be r eplaced, as did
the windows and wiring. There was an oldfireplace and three layers of dirty carpet.‚Äô

all the internal walls to create an open-plankitchen, dining and living area. It seemed thebest way to achieve a sense of light and space.‚Äô
It was eight months before they were granted
planning permission and could put their ideasinto practice. The couple stayed in the windmillwhile the six-month tra nsformation took place.
‚ÄòWe took down the walls and ceiling and toreup the floorboards, so that only the exteriorwalls and roof were left,‚Äô says Jeltje. ‚ÄòIt gave thebuilder an empty shell to work with. Luckily, wehad a good contractor and everything wentsmoothly. He made the building structurallysound, installed insulation and underfloorheating, and even built the kitchen, bathroomand storage. He made all our ideas come to life.‚Äô
It can be hard to make a small space look
uncluttered, or an all-white room feel warmand cosy, but the Smits have achieved both.Creating a clean, spare background was key.The flooring is poured concrete with ananhydride layer, giving a smooth base that lookslike resin but is cheaper. The couple chosehandleless kitchen units for a fuss-free effect andsleek and contemporary bathroom fittings. Thed√©cor throughout is a minimal palette of white,cream and wood. ‚ÄòThe walls in our old housewere white because it made the rooms seemmore spacious,‚Äô says Jeltje. ‚ÄòEven though

Upstairs, in the revamped roofspace, the former bedroom has been dividedinto a study and a nursery. ‚ÄòDuring the move,I found out I was pregnant,‚Äô says Jeltje, whohas since given birth to a daughter, Steffi. ‚ÄòThishouse makes a wonderful family home andwe feel part of a communit y.

For the festive season, Jeltje has filled the
rooms with decorations, many of which arehome-made. And of course, in this house, it‚Äôsguaranteed to be a white Christmas. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôrelooking forward to spending time at home asa family,‚Äô says Jeltje. ‚ÄòMy parents, grandmotherand our siblings will all be coming over.‚Äô

and Ruben Stephensonbought their first hometogether, they hadno idea that the oncedilapidated Georgian
town house would become such a sociable hub,especially during the festive season. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve gotsuch lovely neighbours,‚Äô says Rachel. ‚ÄòOne year,a Christmas party turned into an open house ‚Äì80 revellers squeezed in for a fun evening.‚Äô
The couple chose to buy a house in the
Portsmouth Harbour area, close to where theircommercial-diving business is based, and whenthey discovered this period property, they knew
‚û∫it was the one for them. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve always wanted tolive in a character home and I was blown awayby the place,‚Äô says Ruben. ‚ÄòThe sea views areamazing and I decided that no matter whatcondition it was in, we‚Äôd have to buy it.‚Äô
However, the couple had a reality check
when they were confronted with the property‚Äôstired interior. ‚ÄòIt had been a rental property foryears and was bland and soulless,‚Äô says Rachel.‚ÄòAll the character had been ripped out orcovered up, and it still had an outside loo.‚Äô

The couple lived in the house for a year as
they worked out how to remodel the higgledy-piggledy layout and began to decide on thelook they wanted. Aiming to preserve theproperty‚Äôs character, they opted for a traditionalfeel but with contemporary elements mixed infor a fresh, eclectic look. ‚ÄòWe were also keen tohave children an d wanted to make the house
family friendly,‚Äô says Rachel.
In 2008, the work began. An open-plan
kitchen-diner was created downstairs, while onthe first floor, walls were repositioned and abathroom removed to create a larger bedroomand shower room. To make space for a family
bathroom on the third floor, walls in the twobedrooms were repositioned. Rotting windowswere replaced, brickwork exposed and floorseither relaid or carpeted.
After their children, Millie and Zeb, were
born, the couple needed more space. Theydecided to convert the loft into a main

|57 housetohome.co.uk/idealhomemagazine JANUARY 2016Christmas is all about celebrating
with friends and family,  but when the festive seasoncoincides with your weddinganniversary, there‚Äôs even morecause to string up the fairy 
lights and make a toast with a glass ofChampagne. Miranda Huijs and Machiel vander Plas got married at Christmas three yearsago. ‚ÄòWe have a bauble from our honeymoonhotel that comes out every year as a memento,‚Äôsays Miranda. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a special time of year for us,as not only does it mark our commitment toeach other, it‚Äôs also when our children cametogether as one big, blended family. We invitelots of relatives to share the celebrations with us.‚Äô
There couldn‚Äôt be a better place for a family
party. This detached villa in the pretty Dutchtown of Velp was originally a grocer‚Äôs shop.When Miranda and Machiel Ô¨Årst saw it in June2008, the large front room still had its originalstore Ô¨Åttings, including honey-colouredwooden shelves they were determined to keep.Unfortunately, the rest of the listed buildingwas in poor repair. 
The roof leaked, the ground Ô¨Çoor was divided
into a series of sma ll, impracti cal spaces, the
Ô¨Çoors and window frames were rotten, andthere was damp throughout. But there were  a few magical remnants that hinted at theproperty‚Äôs potential ‚Äì enamelled tiles aroundthe entrance, oak beams, glass-panelled doorsand high, decorative ceilings. ‚ÄòWe didn‚Äôt

Ô¨Åve months later, the house was ours.‚Äô
Machiel is an expert in period renovations
‚Äì he founded his company, Hermon Erfgoed,
which specialises in the restoration of religiousand historic monuments, in 2012. Miranda,  a former youth worker, is now a projectmanager for the business. But, back in 2008,their focus was on creating a home for theirchildren from their previous relationships.‚ÄòMachiel and I both wanted a fresh start and weneeded a place that was big enough for our twofamilies,‚Äô Miranda explains. ‚ÄòWe started fromscratch, taking nothing from our former homes,and we‚Äôve Ô¨Ålled this house with things we bothlike. Luckily, our tastes are very similar.‚Äô
T h ef a m i l yl i v e di nt h eh o u s ef o ray e a r
while Miranda and Machiel plotted out therestoration project and obtained planningpermission for the various structural changesthey wanted. They then moved into rentedaccommodation nearby for the next year, hiringa local contractor to carry out the work. Aswell as the necessary repairs to the roof, Ô¨Çoorsand windows, the major change was thereconÔ¨Åguration of walls to create larger roomsand improve the Ô¨Çow of the space.
‚ÄòOur goal was to pare back the rooms, so the
period features wouldn‚Äôt Ô¨Åght with the rest ofthe d√©cor,‚Äô says Miranda. ‚ÄòApart from Eva andIsa‚Äôs bedroom and the bathroom, the househas white walls and waxed wood Ô¨Çoors. I look

The former shop room is a showcase for
Miranda‚Äôs decorating style. The originalÔ¨Çoor-to-ceiling cabinets have been left insitu and are now Ô¨Ålled with everything fromdinnerware to scarves ‚Äì the trappings of familylife with Ô¨Åve children. For most of the year,this room is used as an ofÔ¨Åce, but at Christmasthe desks are replaced with a dining table and it becomes the setting for feasts with theextended family. Glass-panelled doors give aglimpse into the living room beyond, where  a wood burner sits in front of the originalfireplace. A scattering of cushions and rugslink the ChesterÔ¨Åeld sofa and leather armchair.
Across the central hall, the couple removed
the ceiling-height cupboard that divided the kitchen and dining area. ‚ÄòIt made the roommore spacious,‚Äô Miranda explains.
Upstairs was a similar story, as they knocked
through two small rooms to create Eva and Isa‚Äôsbedroom. A further two rooms at the back ofthe house were combined to create a luxuriousbathroom with an oval bath as its centrepiece.‚ÄòI saw a photo of this bath in a magazine andI had to have it,‚Äô says Miranda, who admits herbiggest indulgence is sinking into the bubblesand gazing at the sky through the Velux window.
‚ÄòWhen we‚Äôre restoring properties, Machiel
and I work hard to Ô¨Ånd the heart of the house,‚Äôsays Miranda. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm really proud we‚Äôve achievedthat in our home, too. The fact that our familylooks forward to gathering here to celebrateChristmas ‚Äì and our anniversary ‚Äì is a tributeto its warm and welcoming atmosphere.‚Äô

| 69 housetohome.co.uk/idealhomemagazine  JANUARY 2016When Christine Hayes
told friends that  she and her husband Gary had bought  an empty shell of aproperty, she wasn‚Äôt 
exaggerating. Altho ugh the newl y built house
had a basic kitchen and bathroom, there wereno Ô¨Åreplaces, no Ô¨Çooring and no other Ô¨Åttings.But that was perfect for Christine. ‚ÄòI wanted  to create a home just for us, so the fact thatwe didn‚Äôt inherit someone else‚Äôs ideas was abonus,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòWe were moving from a small,two-bedroom, semi-detached house into a placewith lots of light and space, and plenty of scopefor ideas, so I couldn‚Äôt wait to get started.‚Äô
Christine and Gary wanted to introduce
a modern, classic style that would stand the testof time. ‚ÄòI love to use a grey-and-white palettefor its overall feeling of sophistication, butI can‚Äôt live without the odd pop of colour, too,‚Äôsays Christine. ‚ÄòI also wanted to bring in lots
‚û∫of different textural layers with wool, linen and velvet, to create a sense of luxury.‚Äô
As the couple began to shape their new 
look, Christine realised that there was afundamental Ô¨Çaw in the layout of the house that was going to be a hindrance to how theyliked to live. ‚ÄòI always felt that the upstairsspace wa s dispr oportionate to the downstairs,‚Äô
she says. ‚ÄòThe kitchen was quite small and wehad a double garage that we didn‚Äôt really need.‚Äô
The solution was to build a single-storey
extension across the back of the house,removing a utility room in the process, todouble the size of the kitchen. ‚ÄòThe kitchen wasvirtually a no-go area while the work was beingdone, so we set up a makeshift kitchen in theliving room and managed like that until thenew Ô¨Åttings were installed,‚Äô says Christine.
Next, they turned one of the garages into
a dining room and used part of the remaininggarage to cre ate a new u tility s pace. Roof lights
were installed in the extension to let more3Kitchen

now lead out to the walled garden at the back ofthe house. ‚ÄòThe extension and conversions havealmost doubled the size of the downstairs livingspace and made the house more balanced,‚Äô saysChristine. ‚ÄòA lot of people these days like tohave an open-plan dining room and kitchen,but we were keen to have a formal dining room,so we had somewhere really comfortable andcosy to sit when we are entertaining friendsand family, away from the cooking smells andparaphernalia of the kitchen.‚Äô
Christine‚Äôs great talent is in creating a
cohesive look throughout her entire home.The colour scheme of sophisticated, soothingneutrals looks all the more luxurious withher choice of rich but subtle accent shades,including deep burgundy, pink and green,enhancing each room.
In the living room, plenty of cushions, bold
fabric designs and layers of textiles createan intimate space that comes into its own
‚û∫on cold winter nights. Christine felt a focal point here was essential. ‚ÄòIf there is no centralfeature in a room, it can be very difÔ¨Åcult toarrange the furniture,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòI think livingrooms are much cosier with a proper Ô¨Åreplaceand we didn‚Äôt skimp on ours as we wanted it to be a key piece.‚Äô They chose an Elgin & Halldesign for its warm tones and simplicity.  ‚ÄòWe took those simplistic elements through the whole house so that the rooms would flow seamlessly, even though they all havedifferent identities,‚Äô says Christine.
The couple gradually replaced all the
furniture that they had brought from theirprevious house, with sofas, beds, lampsand tables more suited to the size of theirnew home. ‚ÄòWe bought things as and whenwe could afford them, until we had Ô¨Ånallyupgraded everything,‚Äô says Christine.
The d√©cor is an ongoing process and
Christine loves to introduce fresh trends fromtime to time. ‚ÄòRight now, I have my eye on6Main bedroom
‚ÄòI like layers of neutral

1Choose your base colour Whether
it‚Äôs Ô¨Çooring or a wall, the base colour
will be the largest area of colour in your
room, so place a generous sample of itonto your board. Including carpet sampleswill help you think about texture, too.
2Add an accent tone A dramatic
contrast or an accent just a few tones
away from your base colour? Use yourmoodboard to play with options andlayer it with swatches of fabric, scrapsof wallpaper and paint colour charts.
3Find the right accessories
These will really set the tone in your
room ‚Äì go for ones that share an accent
colour and stick to a single theme. Don‚Äôtmix styles, or your Ô¨Ånished scheme willlook messy rather than effortlessly eclectic.Design your
own moodboard

balanced scheme, keep 70% of
the elements (say, walls and Ô¨Çoors)
as one colour, then add 20% ina second colour (fabrics) and10% in an accent (accessories).
2THE PATTERN RULE When
mixing patterns, use large with 
medium or medium with small,never large with small. Pick printsthat share a colour in common.
3T H EP A I N T E DB O XR U L E
The look of paint changes
according to the time of day andthe light in a room. Paint the insideof a large box with a tester tocreate a miniature ‚Äòroom‚Äô and seehow the colour changes duringthe day within a 3D space.
AND FINALLY‚Ä¶ Always add
a surprise. A focal point ‚Äì whetherit‚Äôs a feature wall or a piece of art‚Äì is the short cut to a ‚Äòwow‚Äô room.Decorating?

Space-saving showers
The hectic pace of modern life
means that we shower far more
than we soak ,with the average
Briton taking 227 showers each
year, according to LateRooms.But old habits die hard, and mosthomeowners are reluctant toditch their bathtub permanently.
So, to help us squeeze both into
smaller bathrooms or en suites,shower specialist Roman has createda collection of new shower enclosureswith doors that swing partiallyinwards. This handily keeps intrusioninto bathroom s pace to a minimum,
as well as adding a modern look.
The Lumin8 Inswing shower
enclosure comes in four sizes, witha choice of widths from 76cm to120cm. What‚Äôs more, the wideframeless doorway means you can
get in and out comfortably in even
the smallest bathroom, no matter how speedy you need to be.

WHAT THEY DID 
The Shorts extended andcompletely remodelled theoriginal house over the course of several years, which hasopened up the interior living space. Joan and Richard have also improved the property‚Äôsexternal appearance byupgrading the roof andcladding, and installing newaluminium-framed windows.

| 104 JANUARY 2016  housetohome.co.uk/idealhomemagazinePROPERTY IDEAS Feature windowsWhen Joan and Richard
Short purchased theircurrent home in 1992,they knew they weretaking on a project buthad no idea of exactly
what was in store. ‚ÄòUp until then we‚Äôd livedin a succession of modern family homes inLetchworth Garden City, but when our twoboys became teenagers, we thought it was timeto find somewhere to settle,‚Äô explains Joan.
Location was their key consideration, and
the Hertfordshire house they chose stands in aquiet, tree-lined road of in dividually designed
detached properties built in the Sixties andSeventies. ‚ÄòIt had been rented out for a while,the internal d√©cor was tired and the garden wasovergrown, which made the price competitive,‚Äôsays Joan. ‚ÄòWe could see it had potential, andwe had the time and energy to take it on.‚Äô
The couple added two straightforward
extensions: a single-storey, full-width rear one,A barrel-vaulted roof above
a large arched window looks
smart and contemporary
to inviting modern home
We love‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶‚Äòthe greater
levels of light
and theoverall senseof space that
now runs
throughoutthe house‚Äô which enlarged the living room and created  
a breakfast room and games room, and anextension above the garage to create a fifthbedroom. Then, about five years ago, the Shortsbegan considering whether they should movehouse again. They felt the downstairs of theproperty had too many rooms and doors, andnot enough usea ble sp ace, w hile the hallway
and rear ground-floor extensions felt dark.
‚ÄòIn the end, we decided we were settled here,
and instead we‚Äôd invest in giving our house the wow factor,‚Äô says Richard. ‚ÄòIt was definitelydated and low on kerb appeal, with poorlyconstructed dormer windows. These reducedthe size of the two front bedrooms, which werevery hot in summer and cold in winter.‚ÄôTIME FOR A CHANGE  After c
onsidering a
number of local architects, Joan and Richardchose Pentangle Design Group in nearbyHitchin (01462 431133; pentangledesign.co.uk),as they felt that partner Robert Downing was intune with their aims for the house. Together Joan and
Richard ShortNew weatherboard
cladding, glazing and  
clay tiles have given 
the extended property  
a fresh new look
‚û∫
| 105 housetohome.co.uk/idealhomemagazine  JANUARY 2016they devised a plan to remodel the front of the
property in a way th at would be accepta ble to
both the planners and the Letchworth GardenCity Heritage Foundation. 
‚ÄòWithin five minutes of Robert‚Äôs follow-up
visit, we knew his proposal would achieve all of our objectives,‚Äô says Joan. ‚ÄòFrom a budgetingperspective, we decided to complete the workin phases ‚Äì tackling the front of the house in2012 and the rear in 2013. We also allocated  a budget of ¬£250,000 for the entire project.‚ÄôGETTING STARTED On
ce planning
permission had been granted for all thealterations, the Shorts tendered the project  to a number of builders, and selected a  long-established contractor, DB Sharp & Sons (01462 672359; dbsharpandsons.co.uk),  who they knew would complete the work  to a high standard. The builder assigned  a project manager to ensure that everythingwas completed on schedule, with phases one and two each taking six months. 
‚ÄòWe carried on living in the house throughout
this time, and because all the external work was tackled during the winter months, it  was always cold inside,‚Äô says Joan. ‚ÄòWe hadcorrugated sheeting rattling and plasticflapping throughout the night, with dusteverywhere, and we had to use a campingkitchen to cook for three months.‚Äô
Working within the current footprint, the
internal layout has been reorganised to createmore useable living space, inc orporating highly ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve received so many positive comments from
friends and family. It has become the house of our
dreams and there‚Äôs nothing we would change‚Äô
efficient heating and ventilation systems.  A modern, redesigned kitchen with the latestappliances and gadgets replaced the little-usedgames room overlooking the rear garden, andhigh levels of natural light are now delivered to all parts of the house through expansivewindows, glass doors and roof lights.ADDING KERB APPEAL  Th
e property‚Äôs
protruding front walls were extended upwardsto replace the existing inset dormer windowsand enlarge the bedrooms on the first floor.Externally, the brick house has been clad in hand-made clay tiles and oak weatherboardingfor a smarter appearance. ‚ÄòThe oak-clad sectionwas built in blockwork, and the main bedroom is timber framed, with structural steelwork tosupport the upper level,‚Äô says Richard.
The existing windows were replaced with
energy-efficient, aluminium-framed ones,which are powder coated in dark grey. A newbarrel-vaulted zinc roof creates a dynamicvaulted first-floor landing/seating area at thetop of the stairs, where a bespoke arched oakwindow looks out over the front garden.
Despite some late deliveries of materials, 
the builder worked rigidly to the deadline, and when the front elevation of the house was unveiled for the first time, the Shorts were stunned by the transformation. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôvereceived so many positive comments from ourfriends and family,‚Äô says Joan. ‚ÄòIt has becomethe house of our dreams and there‚Äôs absolutelynothing we would change.‚ÄôA bank of roof

KNOW-HOW
Joan and Richard fitted smart new
windows, including a bespokearched one made by a local joiner, to transform the look of their home.‚ñ† The right window can dramatically
improve a property‚Äô
s appearance, 
its energy efficiency and security.  A simple alteration to size or shapecan also let much more light flood in.
‚ñ† Purpose-made windows will take
longer and be more costly to fit thanoff-the-shelf versions, but one or twobespoke feature windows can addpersonality to a house ‚Äì from cornerglazing to arched or round designs. IN DETAIL FEATURE WINDOWS

looking for a renovationproject when they boughttheir house in Middlesexin 2005. ‚ÄòHowever, thisproperty did offer us the
potential to build out at a later date and weneeded that Ô¨Çexibility, as we were expecting
our second child at the time,‚Äô says Alex.
Some years later, Alex longed for a kitchen
that the whole family could enjoy. ‚ÄòThe originallayout was galley style,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòIt was
completely outdated, with an exposed boiler,and there wasn‚Äôt even space for a family sizedfridge, so we kept ours in the dining room.Fortunately, Shaun‚Äôs an architect, so hedesigned our open-plan rear extension.‚Äô
Alex‚Äôs dream kitchen was a practical space
for baking, with plenty of storage and room forthe whole family to sit and talk. When it cameto choosing a design, she wanted traditionalShaker-style units and heritage paint colours,with modern touches, such as dark laminateÔ¨Çooring and spotlights. ‚ÄòI went for a timelesslook,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòNow, I‚Äôm totally head-over-heelsin love with the room we‚Äôve created.‚Äô

WHO LIVES HERE
Libby and Adam Lygoe, with theirchildren, Lucas, 15, and Holly, 10.
WHAT THEY DID
The couple lowered the ceiling onthe first floor by 22cm to create moreheadroom in the loft area, then theyboxed out and squared off the loft spaceto form straight walls. They alsoinstalled a skylight and hadthe en-suite bathroom tanked.

FORWHERETOBUYITEMSSHOWN, TURN THE PAGE
Tired of years of renting, Libby
and Adam Lygoe decided to buya Victorian house that neededrefurbishing. ‚ÄòAs we‚Äôd neverrenovated before, we didn‚Äôt geta total wreck,‚Äô says Libby. ‚ÄòIt had
been renovated 12 years before, but we wantedto bring it up to date and make it our own.‚Äô
The couple, who have two children, decided
to convert the loft, coming up with a plan thatincluded a main bedroom with an en suite.‚ÄòDesigning the best layout was key to theroom‚Äôs success and I couldn‚Äôt believe that abath and a shower would Ô¨Åt without lookingcramped,‚Äô says Libby. ‚ÄòBut that‚Äôs what weachieved, thanks to a brilliant design company.‚Äô
Maximising space and light was key, so they
cleverly added extra height. ‚ÄòWe included a Ô¨Çatskylight, which is recessed into the roof,‚Äô saysLibby. ‚ÄòThis drenches the room in light andincreases the head height, as it was formed withan upstand higher than the rest of the ceiling.‚Äô
Keeping the d√©cor neutral has allowed Libby
to update the bathroom easily. ‚ÄòI can freshenthe look quickly by using different towels andaccessories,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòI love our en suite ‚Äìit‚Äôs a tranquil retreat from busy family life.‚ÄôBEFORE

QW H A TI SAB L O G ?
A blog is a website or web page
written
by an individual or a small
team in a tone that‚Äôs quite chatty and
informal. Posts appear in reversechronological order, with the mostrecent at the top. The majority of blogsare interactive, so readers can leavecomments at the end of posts toencourage further discussion.
QWHY DO IT?
N o to n l yi sab l o gag r e a tc r e a t i v e
o
utlet, providing the opportunity
to explore a passion for writing,
photography or whatever it is that firesy o uu p ,b u ti tc a na l s oh e l py o uf i n dand connect with like-minded peopleonline. The sense of communityamong bloggers is strong ‚Äì tap intothat and you‚Äôll find people who willinspire and support you. Bloggingconferences, such as Blogtacular(blogtacular.com), provide themeans to meet these virtual friendsface-to-face, as well as offering youadvice and knowledge.
QWHAT TO BLOG ABOUT?
Some people treat their blog
like an online diary, while others focuson a particular subject, such as food,fashion, parenting, interiors or crafts.You could use it to talk about yourfamily, your work ‚Äì something you‚Äôrereally passionate about. It‚Äôs importantto love the subject you choose to blogabout because this will come throughnaturally in your posts, which is thesecret to attracting loyal readers.
QWHAT D OID OF I R S T ?
You n eed to come up with a name
for your blog. Take your time with this‚Äì it‚Äôs better to brainstorm and mullover your ideas than to sprint offwith the first thing you think of andpossibly regret it later. This namecould be with you for years to come,  so putting the initial effort into findingsomething that feels right is wellworth it. Ideally, you want that magiccombination of something memorablethat also sums up what your blog isabout. If you can include a searchable
term to help lead people to your blog,then that‚Äôs even better. Type your
possible names into a search engine‚Äì you don‚Äôt want to pick something
that‚Äôs already out there. You can alsocheck if the domain name (webaddress) is available on sites such
as 123-reg.co.uk or tsohost.com.
QWHAT NEXT?So you know what you want to
blog 
about and you‚Äôve chosen your
n a m e .N o wy o un e e dap l a t f o r m‚Äìt h esoftware or service that turns a regularsite into a functioning blog ‚Äì it‚Äôll do allthe technical stuff for you, so it doesn‚Äôtmatter if you aren‚Äôt a web genius.There are a lot of platforms available‚Äì some are free, such as Blogger orWordPress.com, while some arepaid-for services, s uch as S quares pace.

Blogging platforms offer their ownrange of templates, or you can buythem elsewhere on sites such as Etsy,Themeforest or Blogzilla.
QHOW DO I GET READERS?Once you‚Äôve started producing
posts, 
you‚Äôll want people to read them.
Social-media platforms offer a great
way to invite an audience over to yourblog. There are so many platforms thatyou can use, such as Twitter, Facebook,Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, Vine,you probably won‚Äôt be able to keep upwith them all.

yourself
you‚Äôd start eating breakfast or
stop spending so much on lunch? Then
you need a blender that can blitz upa single smoothie or even a serving ofsoup in seconds. Best of all, they cando the job in a cup you take away withyou, so there‚Äôs no messy decanting orextra washing up. If your mornings arechaotic, prep your ingredients the night
before, put them into the blending
beaker and pop it in the fridge. The
next day, just grab the beaker, blitz the contents, add a lid and you‚Äôre ready
to go. I throw in a couple of ice cubesbefore blending, so my oaty breakfastsmoothie stays cold on the commute‚Äì if you want to do the same, choosea machine that‚Äôs designed to crush ice.
PRODUCTS WE

And there are agrowing number of hub-basedsystems that allow you to controlmultiple gadgets from one appand create rules (see 4 and 5, right).Importantly, the gadgets are reallyeasy to set up: just downloadthe companion app, power themup and press a few buttons toconnect your gadgets to yourWi-Fi.

SENSORS
‚ÄòContact‚Äô sensors send an
alert to your phone whensomeone opens a windowor closes a door, so you‚Äôllknow the kids are homefrom school, for example.Moisture sensors detectleaks, and motion sensorswill tell you if the dog or,far worse, a burglar getsinto your bedroom.FIT KEYLESS
LOCKS
Always losing keys? With Yale‚Äôs
keyless locks, you can gain
entry by typing in a PIN code or ‚Äì if it‚Äôs
hooked up to a Samsung SmartThingshub ‚Äì with your smartphone. Then, if thekids have been locked out, you can letthem in remotely, and if you think you‚Äôveleft the house unlocked, just check andlock up with the app. You can also set upPINs that expire or only work at certaintimes of day, and give them to a cleaneror visiting family instead of a spare key.1

Wi-Fi cameras give a wide-angle
view of what‚Äôs happening at home
24/7, which you can see from an app on
your phone. They‚Äôll also record footage of
unusual activity triggered by movement
or noise, and send an alert so you can
act immediately, as it‚Äôs happening.How much you‚Äôll be able to record(and how much it costs) varies, but
most systems will give you some free
recordings, which are held securely in
the cloud for a few days to give you the
chance to download them. Some cameras
have two-way microphones, so if you have
one Ô¨Åtted at the front door and a postman
arrives with a parcel, you‚Äôll be able to tell them
where to leave it. Alternatively, if there‚Äôs one in the
kitchen and you‚Äôre at the shops wondering whether
you need to buy milk, you can ask whoever‚Äôs at home! 
SET UP RULES
Once your gadgets can talk
to each other via a hub, it‚Äôspossible to set up rules, so that
if the system detects one thing,
it does another. For example, if
a Samsung SmartThings motion
sensor spots you‚Äôve arrived
home, it can turn on Lifxlightbulbs and your Bose stereo.
Or if a Nest Protect detects
smoke or carbon monoxide, it can
tell your Philips Hue lightbulbs to
Ô¨Çash red ‚Äì useful if a nyone at home
is hard of hearing. Just ensure that the
gadgets are compatible with your hub
and visible in your hub‚Äôs app.4B U YAH O M EH U B  
This connects to your

Always place lit candles well away from foliage, furniture, curtains and soft furnishings,and always out of draughts Keep candles out of reach of children and pets  Never leave 
a burning candle unattended Keep candles away from hair and clothing  
Always place candles upright in suitable holders that can‚Äôt easily
fall over  Always be sure that candles are properly extinguishedBE
