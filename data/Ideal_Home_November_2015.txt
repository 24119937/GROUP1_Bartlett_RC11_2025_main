HOME COMMUNITYMy to-do list
for November
The things I’ll be planning, doing 
and shopping for this month
Now that winter’s set in, I’m
claiming the cosiest sofa spot,dusting off my needlework  
box and craving hot puddings…DOING THINGS WITH APPLES It turns
o
ut that the apple tree at the bottom of
the garden of my new house is a proliﬁcfruiter. Being a ‘waste not, want not’ kindof person, I’ve been diligently storingall the apples wrapped in ne wspaper in
the garage, giving rise to all manner ofapple-related projects: oven-dried appleslices; baked apples; stewed apples; apple
printing with the littlest Richmonds… butstrictly no apple pies or apple crumblesbecause I am now a fully paid-up memberof WeightWatchers and on a mission tobe back in a size 12 by Christmas. NowI’ve gone public, I’ll have to stick to it!
REVIVING OLD
 HOBBIES The WW
r
egime means my usual winter weekend
pleasures have been curtailed somewhat.
Once the chores are done and anyvisiting Richmonds and/or associateshave been safely seen off the premises,I would normally launch myself onto thesofa, armed with a large bar of Galaxy and
a snifter, to binge-watch Homes Under
the Hammer or
Escape to the Country(I have a soft spot forthe ruddy-cheeked JulesHudson). But Galaxy’s onthe banned list and sniftersare limited to one deliciousG&T (Hendricks mixed withFevertree tonic, cucumberslices and a couple of basilleaves), so I’m keeping mymind off fat- and sugar-based foods by picking uplong-abandoned knittingand cross-stitch projects.
BUYING VINTAGE Quite a
w
hile ago now, I interviewed an
antiques expert, Toma Haines ofantiquesdiva.com, for a feature.
She spoke so passionately about theemotional value of old things, ratherthan their monetary or historical value,I’ve been toying with the idea of buyingsomething vintage for my own home.So far, I haven’t had the conﬁdenceto haggle with a dealer or make a bid,but recently I’ve shifted my focus tofurnitureetc.co.uk – a new marketplacesite for one-off, preloved furniture thatsorts the wheat from the chaff for you.I’ve got my eye on a retro drinks trolley(to make those snifters a real event…),but if you’re into shabby-chic, industrial ortraditional style, you’ll ﬁnd lots to love, too.

/" Artist and designer Laura
Oakes special ises in a
striking digital decoupagetechnique, which is created
by layering eclectic images, antiqueillustrations and a combination of herown photographs and drawings ina bold colour palette. She started outcreating one-off pieces for clientsbefore launching a range for Liberty,and this year was invited to be oneof Debenhams’ Edition designers,showcasing an exclusive collection ofcushions, lampshades and accessories.
‘I believe that everyone has the right
to own art – it should be accessible,not elitist,’ says Laura. ‘So whenDebenhams approached me, I felt itw a sag r e a tw a yo fm a k i n gm yw o r kavailable to a much wider audience.’
Based in a studio-cum-gallery in
Rye, East Sussex, Laura creates andprints her designs digitally, thentransfers them to a range of products,which are all made in the UK. Hercollections are constantly changingto incorporate new ideas and styles.
‘I’m currently working on a more
reﬁned and limited-edition collectionof homeware, as well as experimentingon a range of leather jackets withcelebrity stylist Rachel Anthony andher consultancy The Cabal,’ explainsLaura. ‘This is my ﬁrst foray intofashion and I’m really excited tosee how my designs translate intoa different medium.’
THE WOMAN BEHIND THE LOOK
Born and brought up in Brighton,La
ura enjoyed spending time
outdoors, climbing trees, or at thebeach searching for shells andtreasure with her father and youngerbrother. ‘Growing up, my role model
was my grandfather,’ says Laura.‘He was a quiet man, gentle andthoughtful, always doing things forFORWHERETOBUYITEMSSHOWN, TURN TO OUR SHOPPING DIRECTORYHIGH STREET

A background in illustration and 
the visual arts was a key factor inLaura’s career. ‘After completing anillustration degree at the University  of Westminster, I went on to study foran MA in communication design atCentral St Martin’s. A top advertisingagency then offered me a job, but Idecided to get out of London insteadand set up on my own. I think I alwaysknew I wouldn’t be someone who wouldﬁt into a particular box, but my career OUT ON SHOW

I chose – setting up my own companycame about in a very organic way.’
CAREER PATH
Laura’s big break came when she wasa
pproached by Liberty. ‘It was an
amazing opportunity, as I had spentmany a childhood outing in Londonin awe of the Liberty building and itsfabrics,’ she explains. ‘After the meeting  with the head buyer,  I wandered around London in a daze, shocked that they actually wanted to  stock my products.’
Constantly driven  
to ﬁnd new ways ofcommunicating throughher work, Laura is at her happiest and most fulﬁlled when creating a piece of art.‘The idea that what I create givespleasure to others is something thatis really important to me,’ she says.‘Everyone should be able to havesomething in their home that makesthem feel good. I also like the ideathat my creations can be passed onto future generations. That’s why themanufacturing process is importantto me, too, and one of the main reasonswhy my products are made in the UK.I believe there has to be integrity inhow my work is created.’
Laura lives in a detached bungalow
on Winchelsea beach with her partner,Jamie, and Pixie the dog. Her homeis also a reﬂection of her unique style.
‘It’s very eclectic,’ sheexplains. ‘Most of myfurniture is vintage,so it’s a real mixtureof styles. As you wouldimagine, it’s quitecolourful and there’s arteverywhere. I also havelots of carefully curateddisplays of things –vintage and antiquetextiles, doll’s housefurniture and my
treasured photographs and books –somehow it all seems to work together.’

approach tointerior design,
Laura’s unique style is influencedby her love of history, nostalgia,travel and the world around her.‘I collect books and photographs,and these are where most of theimages I use in my designs comefrom,’ she says. ‘I love anythingthat has a history and a storybehind it, so I can’t walk past anold junk shop without rescuing something. I have a particularinterest in Victorian ephemera– postcards, calling cards, photos,packaging, fabric and wallpaper,and have an obsession withcollecting things with anemotional attachment. I like tocreate pieces that are unique, thathave a sense of the past but don’tfeel old-fashioned, so I combinethe vintage imagery I love with abold, contemporary colour palette.A lot of customers tell me a piecehas reminded them of someonespecial, or of a significant event intheir lives, which for me is lovely.’FEATURE KAREN BRAYPERFECT

and Mark Walters’ red-bricksemi in Nottingham looks likethe neighbouring houses, but theinside tells a different story. Theyhave rearranged the interior
space, knock ed down walls a nd installed their
own striking design innovations, turning anordinary house into a uniquely stylish one.‘While house hunting, we weren’t looking fora particular type of property,’ says Martin. ‘Welike a lot of different periods and styles, so itwas all about the potential to create somethinginteresting and individual.’
They viewed several options before spotting
the perfect place – this turn-of-the-century semion a quiet street. The house was under offer,but the sale fell through a few weeks later andthe couple snapped it up. ‘We wanted a project 
➺and this was ideal,’ says Martin. ‘We could livein it, but it needed a complete overhaul.’
Apart from the recently refurbished
bathroom, the rooms were bare and the onlyoriginal character left was some cornicing in
the hall and living room. The kitchen was damp,
there were mismatched ﬂoors and draughtywindows, and the décor was old-fashioned.
During the weeks it took to secure the
purchase, Martin and Mark ﬁne-tuned theirideas for transforming their house. Their planswere ambitious, with a wall-to-wall redesign foreach room. ‘The aim was to create an open-planfeel with plenty of light,’ says Martin. ‘We likethe blend of classic and contemporary, butthere has to be a quirky edge that you can’t buyin the shops – and we never do things by halves!’

Fitting theseproved to be one of the biggest jobs, involvingtaking off all the skirting boards and raisingsections of the ﬂoor to get a consistent level.
‘For about six months, there was brick dust
everywhere and it was dirty, messy and cold,’recalls Martin. ‘We had a limited budget, so wedid most of the work ourselves with help fromfamily. It was difﬁcult, but we learnt as muchas we could and focused on the end result.’

One of their most creative ideas is the

The décor, too, lendsthe interior a bright yet inviting feel, withlight-reﬂecting chrome accessories and mirrors. 
The newly plastered rooms were painted

Transforming their home has taken much of
Martin and Mark’s time, energy and money, butthe two have relished the chance to hone theirskills. As a result of the experience, Martinentered and won BBC Two’s The Great Interior

Looking for a change in lifestyle,
Mette Bergmann and her partner,Jon Lucas, decided to movefrom London to the south coast.‘Jon and I had lived in Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex years
previously and had always talked about movingback at some point, so when our daughter, Liv,was just a few months old, we put our Londonhome on the market and decided to go for it,’explains Mette. ‘We couldn’t believe our luckwhen we found this place right on the beach.After years of city living, it was the sort oflocation we had long dreamed of.’
The three-bedroom house had seen better
days, having been built in the Fifties to replaceproperties demolished during the Second WorldWar. It was covered in cheap plastic cladding,

been poorly maintained, leaving it vulnerableto the elements. ‘There were numerous leaksand lots of salt-water damage,’ says Mette.  ‘Also, the front door was at the side of thehouse, which wasn’t very welcoming.’ Inside,  a tired kitchen, grotty bathrooms and multiplewalls that divided up the living areas into small spaces needed rethinking.
Despite the negatives, the couple could see
that the property had the potential to be special.They loved its boxy shape, as it would sit  well with their ideas for Scandi-style, modernliving. ‘With my Danish roots, I’m drawn to  the types of houses I grew up with,’ says Mette. ‘They tend to have simple, clean lines – thekind of design that suits our personalities  and the way we live.

living spaces to be organised, clean and tidy.’
The couple’s idea was to create a beach house
inﬂuenced by modernist architecture. Withonly a small budget, they undertook a lot ofthe work themselves. Jon started on the basics,ripping out the old kitchen and clearing outthe space. ‘He was sleeping on a mattress
on the ﬂoor,’ explains Mette. ‘The heatingwasn’t working and the house wasn’t insulated,so it was freezing. We had two builders livingwith us for the ﬁrst six months, but luckily forme, as Liv was still a baby, I divided my timebetween the house and my family in Denmark.In hindsight, we should’ve lived off site insteadof staying in the house during the works.’
Mette and Jon retained the basic structure
of the building, but changed elements to give ita more modern, streamlined look. The internal

‘We had a clear idea of how the house should
look,’ says Mette. ‘Most importantly, we wantedto be able to appreciate the sea views as soonas we stepped into our li ving space.’ This was
to prove difﬁcult, however, as by far the mostchallenging task was installing the ﬂoor-to-ceiling sliding doors on the ground ﬂoor, aswell as the upstairs windows. Made to measure,the frames were engineered in Germany,  then shipped over and installed on site. ‘Wemistakenly went with the cheapest quote to ﬁtthem and, consequently, our beautiful bespokewindows were poorly installed and leakedconstantly,’ says Mette. ‘It took us almost a yearof complaining to get the workmen to sort theproblem, and during that time we lived withhardboard at the windows to protect us from

boards were taken down, the house was ﬂoodedwith light – it was amazing.’
Mette and Jon saved money on furnishing
the interior by shopping online or going directto suppliers. ‘Modernist principles are notvery forgiving and are labour intensive, assuch high standards are required to get thingsperfect, which often means choosing betweenpracticality, style and budget,’ explains Mette. ‘So we salvaged what we could from theoriginal house, then hunted online fordesigner-inspired pieces. Even Liv helped,painting canvas artworks for the walls.’
Painted white throughout, Mette and Jon’s
home could easily have ended up feeling coldand unwelcoming, but the clever use of warm, ‘W e couldn’t believe our luck when we found this
place right on the beach. After years of city living,
it was the sort of location we had long dreamed of’
natural materials makes it a cosy and friendlyhome. Resisting the urge to use too muchbright colour, they have decorated in a softmonochrome palette that beautifully reﬂectsthe constantly changing seascape beyond thewindows. Occasional bursts of red show thesestormy shades off beautifully. ‘The reason forall the grey, which is a very Danish colour, isbecause it enhances the limited amount ofdaylight we have in winter,’ says Mette.
She thinks that this way of life isn’t for
everyone. ‘Living in a house such as this is likebeing in a glass box with everything on showand we’re very exposed to the elements,’ shesays, ‘but we love the breathtaking seascapes
and the fact that we can open up our home to
the beach, so it becomes an extension of ourgarden. We feel healthier just being here.’

Once the couple’s offer had been accepted,
they set about planning the look they wanted toachieve. ‘We had plenty of time as it took sixmonths to get the keys to the property, bywhich point we knew we wanted an open-planlayout, with industrial-style exposed brickworkand ﬂoorboards,’ says Siobhan.

‘I’m always picking up bits
and bobs from vintage fairs
and charity shops’
it was really hard work and we were both
longing for the day when we weren’t coveredin dust and living on a building site, but wewere very motivated and determined to getthe house we wanted, which kept us going.’
Once the downstairs was complete, the
couple started work on the upstairs. ‘Weopened up the bedsit at the front of the house,which was originally a small kitchen andliving room, and is now my home ofﬁce,’ saysSiobhan. ‘At the back of the house we madethe bathroom bigger by repositioning a wall.’
When it came to furnishing the rooms,
Siobhan plundered local second-hand shops.  ‘I have a magpie’s eye for the quirky andunusual, and am always picking up bits andbobs from vintage fairs and charity shops,’ shesays. ‘Most of the furniture here is second-handstuff that has been rejuvenated with a lick ofpaint. We were also given lots of pieces byfamily and friends, which saved us a huge amount of money. It’s very satisfying to havecreated a stylish home on a shoestring.’
The décor throughout is a mix of white walls,
painted ﬂoorboards, exposed brickwork andcharcoal-grey accents. ‘I wanted a neutralbackdrop so I could introduce bursts of colour
with accessories, which can be updated every
so often,’ says Siobhan, who runs interiorscompany April and the Bear (aprilandthebear.
com). ‘It also allowed me to experiment with
murals using washi tape, which makes a great
alternative to wallpaper.’
The hard work has paid off and the couple
now have a totally different house from theone they bought. ‘It was worth all the latenights and full-on weekends,’ says Siobhan.‘There were a few ups and downs, but you haveto keep your eye on the end result and keepgoing. There’s still a bit left to do, but I thinkrenovation projects are never ﬁnished. Let’sjust say, it’s very much a work in progress!’

started searching fora new family home, topo fh e rw i s hl i s tw a saproperty with plenty ofperiod features that she
could make her creative mark on. ‘As I walkedthrough the door of this pl a c e ,Ik n e wi tw a st h e

It had all theselovely details, such as chunky radiators andbrass-dolly light switches, and the finish wasvery high quality.’ With its original fireplaces,beautiful cornicing and sash windows, thehouse was exactly what Lucy and her husbandPhilip were looking for, and the deal was sealed.
Lucy undertook a radical overhaul of the
interior colour scheme, using a palette of greyshades that has transformed the house, withall its period features, into a styli sh space. ‘I’ve

in changing light and all sorts of differentsituations,’ says Lucy. ‘I knew exactly whattones I wanted to use – I’ve been trained indesign, which gave me the confidence to makeit work – and Philip was totally up for it, too.’
However, before tackling the interior, the 
first thing Lucy did was to make over thehouse’s exterior, the lower half of which is now painted a cool dove grey, with a steel-greyfront door. ‘There was a big hedge and acrumbling wall in the front garden,’ Lucyexplains. ‘We had to remove the hedge to fixthe wall, and the neighbours said we’d miss the privacy it gave, but the garden looks muchbetter now you can see the railings.’
Next, the couple decided to smarten up the
front path by laying classic black-and-whitetiles. The effect is sharp and stylish, a look theyhave transferred to the back garden, wherethey’ve covered the courtyard with bamboo

| 75 housetohome.co.uk/idealhomemagazine  NOVEMBER 2015decking and painted the back wall in a pale
grey shade to reflect li ght into the space.
In the kitchen, Lucy opted for a modern
country feel with industrial touches, includingzinc-covered worktops. ‘I didn’t want woodenworksurfaces, as the ones we’d had before hadrotted,’ says Lucy. ‘I asked Ralph Levy fromThe Handmade House to cover them withzinc for me.’ She co mpleted the makeover by
repainting the cupboard doors a grey shadewith green undertones.
In the hallway and reception rooms, the
décor changes dramatically from light andbright to dark and theatrical, with warm,thundery greys on the walls, sea-spray whiteon the ceilings and colour accents in zesty lime.
Inspiration for the scheme came not froma colour chart but from a vibrant Kosta Bodavase she and Philip bought with some moneythey were given as a wedding present. ‘I loved

A strong shade was chosen for the living-
room walls. ‘I used Marston and Langinger’sPeat, which is very matt and earthier than theFarrow & Ball Down Pipe I used in the hall,’ saysLucy. Then it was easy to bring accent details to the room with accessories, such as the whitestag’s head, a graphic fabric Lucy has stretchedover a large canvas frame and statementlighting, which is Philip’s design contribution. ‘His father was an architect and the light fittingin the middle of the room was a gift from him,’says Lucy. Two opaque cube lights double  up as handy tables either side of the sofa andelegant mid-century furniture, as well as astriking cowhide rug that Philip brought backfrom Australia, complete this individual look.

has a slightly warm grey tinge to it.’
The shutter wardrobe doors were installed
by the previous owners and had come froma French chateau. ‘They wanted to take themwhen they moved, which I didn’t mind initially,but then I realised it would be too complicatedto replace them with something decent, sowe kept them and I love them now,’ she says.
Every day Lucy walks Coco, the family’s
cocker spaniel, on the beach where shephotographs the changing colours of the seaand sky. ‘I kept wondering what to do with all
these images and decided to see if they could
be printed onto silk,’ she says. She spent a yearresearching the process, eventually sourcinga manufacturer and creating some designs that
now grace the lampshades and cushions she
sells under her own label, Slate Grey Sea, allinspired by those coastal walks and her love ofthe colour grey. ‘It feels so good to be able tosay that my home and where I live have trulyinspired my creativity,’ says Lucy.

A four-bedroom, detached
Fifties house in Hampshire.
WHO LIVES HERE
Sheila and Jon Osborne.
WHAT THEY DID
They created extra living spaceabove the garage, changed theroof line, fitted a lead-roofedporch and added an orangery-style extension to the livingroom at the rear. New timberwindows were fitted throughoutand the exterior brickworkwas covered with acrylicrender and weatherboarding.
WHAT IT COST
Sheila and Jon paid £725,000for the house in 2005 andhave spent £440,000remodelling the property,which is currently wortharound £1.4 million./triangleleft

Osborne and their sons– Jack, now 27, andGeorge, 25 – returnedto the UK after livingin Dubai, they were
hunting for a family home in Hampshire withenough space for entertaining. ‘We chose thishouse because of the location,’ explains Sheila.‘We liked the south-facing garden, but thelayout inside didn’t flow well, despite the factthat it had already been extended to the rear.’
MAKING CHANGES Sheila and Jon
s
uccessfully placed a sealed bid for the
detached property in 2005, and lived therefor several years before deciding to employarchitect Paul Gallie of WSW Consultancy(01252 811011; wswconsultancy.co.uk) to carryout some improvements. ‘We explained to Paulthat we never really used the separate diningand living rooms, and that the long, narrowkitchen at the centre of the house served asA mix of pale-painted
weatherboarding, white

doors has created a
fresh, new look

We love…
…‘the new
improved
layout. We now use thewhole house 
rather than
just some ofthe rooms’a thoroughfare,’ explains Sheila. ‘We weren’t
using the whole house and it felt like there was a great deal of wasted space.’
The family spent most of their time in the
central open-plan kitchen area, but hoped  to reorganise the internal layout so that thekitchen would face on to the garden. Paul’ssolution was to convert the dining room into a TV room, with double doors connecting it to an open-plan kitchen, dining and familyroom. The existing living room would beenlarged with a single-storey orangery-styleextension to the rear, incorporating glazedbifold doors on to the garden and a roof lantern to bring in plenty of light from above. 
‘We also wanted to reorganise the layout
upstairs and decided to extend out over thedouble garage to make larger bedrooms andtwo new en-suite bathrooms,’ says Jon. ‘A tinyboxroom has been taken out, and when you go upstairs now the new roof shape creates avaulted ceiling, which gives a real sense of Jon and Sheila

before, but all four are well proportioned.’TRANSFORMING THE OUTSIDE  Extern
ally
the property has also been given a majormakeover and is now pretty unrecognisable.Rendering the brick walls and fixingmaintenance-free composite weatherboardingat first-floor level, installing sash windows andconstructing an oak-framed porch has created a pretty, traditional look. ‘At first, we hadn’tplanned to cover all the external brickwork with acrylic render, but Paul recommended itand we’re so pleased that we went ahead, as therender and weatherboarding give the house theNew England look we like,’ says Sheila. ‘Detailslike the oak posts to the porch and the lead roofover the front door really help to add characterand bring the whole design together.’
The house is within a conservation area, but
planning permission was quickly granted forthe dramatic changes. Building work was thenundertaken by Charlie Brown of MoseleyGreen Bicknell Brown (01420 473162), and was completed in August 2013. 
WORK IN PROGRESS Durin
g this time, it  
was impossible for Sheila and Jon to live in  the house, so they decided to stay in theirSpanish holiday home, returning regularly forprogress reports and staying in touch with theirarchitect and builder on Skype. ‘We trusted ourteam and they sent us regular video updates  of the build,’ says Jon. ‘Everything ran fairlysmoothly, although there was a delay with therendering because of the weather, but overallthe project took only four months to complete.’
The roof was retained where possible and
new sections were built in timber and clad in tiles, which were sourced to match the originals. Foundations were dug for the timberliving-room extension, which was constructedby a joinery company. A roof lantern wasinstalled to keep the room light and bright.Bifold doors lead from the living room andkitchen on to a terrace, which is perfect forentertaining. ‘It was a dark and dingy livingroom before, but now we spend every eveningin there,’ says Sheila. ‘We’re surrounded byglass and feel connected to the outdoors, which really lifts our mood.
‘Family and friends wondered why we were
making such drastic changes to the house,  but when they saw the end result they werecompletely amazed. We almost moved house at one point because the layout wasn’t working,but now we’re so glad we stayed.’ A single-storey
extension has been
added to the rear, and

made
under Permitted
Development , meaning you
don’t need to get planning
permission. For moreinformation on planning andbuilding regulations, visitplanningportal.gov.uk andalways check with yourlocal authority beforemaking any major changes.
■Keep your neighbours
informed at
all stages and
you might need to obtainparty wall agreements,too. Check the advice givenat planningportal.gov.uk.
■For extensions and major
remodelling ,
it’s usually
advisable to employ anarchitect to draw up accurateplans: the Royal Institute ofBritish Architects (architecture.com) holds a directoryof approved architects.
■Get at least three quotes

KNOW-HOW
Adding a roof lantern has totally
transformed Sheila and Jon’s living room, which was previouslydark and uninviting. The work was carried out by OakhangerJoinery (01420 478090;oakhangerjoinery.com).
■ Roof lanterns differ from roof lights
as they project up from the roof
, with
glazed sides bringing in more light
than a flat pane of glass. Lanterns canbe bought off the shelf or made toorder, and can take many forms. Theyare ideal for flat roofs and can haveopening elements for ventilation. IN DETAIL  ROOF LANTERNS
Let light flood in, like the Osbornes did
■ Consider material carefully – timber
has a traditional look but will need tobe treated every few years to keep  it looking good, while UPV
C and
aluminium require less maintenance. ■ Planning permission is not usuallyrequired for installing new rooflanterns, as long as they meet thecriteria in the Planning P
ortal 
(planningportal.gov.uk). 
■ Building regulations will need to 
be met to ensure that the roof isstrong enough to carry the weight  of the lantern and that the structure issufficiently insulated against heat loss.A roof lantern

out and the property was given an extensivemakeover to create a comfortable home.
The Fenwicks first spotted the house when
they were enjoying a weekend break in thecoastal town of Fowey and happened to glancein an estate agent’s window. ‘We both agreedthat it was spectacularly positioned, rightbeside the water, and exactly the type ofhome we’d love to own,’ explains Lizzie. ‘Wediscovered that the sale had just fallen throughthat morning, and impulsively submitted anoffer that was accepted the very next day.’UP FOR A CHALLENGE Th
e house’s décor and
fixtures hadn’t been touched since the Sixties,and many of the rooms felt dark and made noconnection to the river views. ‘We knew wewere taking on a huge project, especially as wecontinued to live in our house in Dorset duringthe work,’ explains Lizzie. ‘We employed aproject manager, who orchestrated a team ofcraftsmen to gut the interior and, as usual withold properties, they uncovered lots of problems.’
The rear of the house is built into the hillside
and was extremely damp. The whole side of the ‘W e linked our home to

A balcony across the
width of the cottage
makes the most of
the beautiful views‘We love the colonial look of the cladding, but living beside
the water means we do get ravaged by the weather, so we
needed to choose robust materials and products’
property had to be tanked and the slate roof
repaired. New wiring and plumbing wereinstalled throughout, walls were replasteredand the kitchen and bathrooms modernised.
Previously the kitchen was small, and an
internal wall was moved to enlarge this roomby stealin g space  from the neigh bouring living
room, while upstairs the master en suite hasbeen divided in two to create a new en suite.CONNECTING WITH OUTSIDE Dra
wing
additional light into the rooms was a key factorin the Fenwicks’ plans, and they began byswapping the grimy secondary double glazingin the kitchen for hand-made wooden Frenchwindows – enlarging existing openings to make the most of the views. A joiner was alsocommissioned to create bespoke woodenframes for the rest of the house to replace themishmash of UPVC and aluminium windows.
One of the biggest structural alterations
involved extending the small balcony Oiled oak floorboards
were laid in the livingroom and a wood-burning stove wasinstalled in the  new fireplace
overlooking the river across the full width of
the cottage. The exterior of the building hasbeen clad in painted timber weatherboarding,which transformed the previously austere stonecottage into a pretty white clapboard house.‘We love the colonial look of the cladding,but living beside the water means we do getravaged by the weather, so we needed tochoose materials and products robust enoughto withstand a coastal environment,’ says Mark.
Lizzie and Mark purchased the cottage for
£465,000 in 2009 and have spent in excessof £250,000 renovating the property, whichis currently worth around £950,000 and isbarely recognisable from the original building.Now sun shines into the well-proportionedrooms and the décor is understated andrelaxing. ‘For us, there’s nothing better thansitting out on the terrace in the evenings,’ saysLizzie. ‘We love listening to the tinkling of boatmasts on the river and never tire of the view.’Trials &
triumphs…
■What was
the
high point?
‘Hunting out
bargains andseeing the cottagetake shape.’
■Any low points?

looking too ‘matched’ Several months after moving into
their London town house in 2012,
Sarah and Iain Urquhart decidedthat the ground-ﬂoor kitchen anddining space would be far better inthe basement. ‘Before, you walked 
straight through the front door into thekitchen, and the room’s high ceilings and hugewindows felt wasted,’ says Sarah. ‘Originally,there would have been a formal living roomupstairs, with the kitchen down below, but theliving room had been put in the dark basement.Changing the layout back to the way the houseused to be just felt like the right thing to do.’
At ﬁrst, swapping the rooms seemed a
daunting task, but keeping the original kitchenintact upstairs while the new one was installedmade it relatively straightforward. Structurally,the only major jobs that needed to be done were to strengthen the chimney breast to makeway for a new range cooker, and to rebuild theceiling that was bowing in the middle.
This, however, used up a large chunk of the
couple’s budget. ‘It meant that we weren’t ableto replace the oak ﬂoor, which, while in fairlygood condition, had been laid badly with lots ofgaps,’ Sarah explains. ‘The orange tone wouldhave clashed with the pale-grey units. But thekitchen company kindly offered to limewashthe ﬂoorboards free of charge if we covered thecost of taking them up and reﬁtting them.’
The couple really enjoy entertaining and the
new kitchen is the perfect space for socialising,with enough room for guests to mingle aroundthe island. It’s given them an informal diningarea, too, as well as access to the garden fromthe kitchen. ‘We’re so glad we did it – it wasworth all the upheaval,’ says Sarah.

Some people may think that AGA
range cookers are just meant forbig, traditional country houses, butwith the launch of the company’s
new series of models, this is certainly notthe case. Thanks to the marriage of design heritage and cutting-edge technology,there’s now an AGA cooker for everyone. 
Keep costs down
For those who want lower running costs,the AGA Total Control is the perfect choice. Its state-of-the-art touch-screen panelenables you to switch each of the ovensand hotplates on and off as you need them,meaning no energy is wasted and runningcosts are from just £5 per week. For theultimate in control, opt for the AGA iTotalControl model, which can be remotely operated via your smartphone. If you prefera cosy kitchen, the AGA Dual Control hasovens that are on all the time but, unliketraditional AGA cookers, you can turn thehotplates on and off independently of theovens, reducing the amount of energy used.
Keep it compact
If you think that your kitchen is far toosmall for an AGA, the 60cm-wide City60is for you. It has two ovens – the top onecan be switched between baking androasting modes, while the bottom is forsimmering – and a single hotplate forboiling and simmering. Room ventedso it can be sited anywhere, the City60model is mounted on wheels, so it’salso easy to take with you if you move,making it a brilliant investment buy.

A grand affair
With its chandelier,white tablecloth and

‘My idea was to mix

abandoned in a skip,
Ir e a l i s e dI ’ df o u n dt h e
centrepiece,’ says KatieWhen Katie Jay planned
h e rk i t c h e nt h eﬁ r s ttime round, she gaveplenty of thought toits contemporary looks.However, 10 years on, it
had become dated. ‘I’d been itching to change
it for a while,’ she says. ‘Then I saw a photo ina magazine of a ramshackle kitchen in a logcabin, which had cabinet doors made from oldtimber and open, planked shelves crammedwith crockery. The seed had been sown and itbecame a ﬁrm plan after we visited some cosy,dark-walled restaurants in Bruges, Belgium.’
Redoing the kitchen didn’t mean starting
from scratch. The units were in good conditionand the existing chrome oven, hob, sink andtaps suited the new look, as did the slate ﬂoortiles. However, Katie soon realised that, to getthe distressed timber fronts she wanted for theunits, she would have to make them herself.
‘I wanted the kitchen to look as freestanding
as possible, so I clad the units in mismatchingtimber,’ she explains. ‘Getting rid of the wallunits and introducing shelves added anotherelement. Lastly, the dining area got an updatewith a traditional chandelier and new chairs.’
And the ﬁnished look? ‘The kitchen makes
a statement and I’ve got the look I wanted,as well as the feeling I was hoping for,’ saysKatie. ‘With the dark-chocolate walls and softlighting, it’s fabulously cosy – and lovinglyrough around the edges.’DIY makeover KITCHEN IDEAS

A friend of mine who has a
workshop cut and routered the
MDF sheets and plywood widths so I could
create the units. I stained and distressed theplywood widths outside, then cut them to fitthe MDF fronts, pinning and gluing them on.I removed the wall units, then my daughter’sboyfriend, Danny, an electrician, preparedthe wall for under-shelf lighting, changed thefronts of the electrical points and hung thechandelier. Painting the walls was a delightas it changed the look immediately. Thework took just three weeks to complete.Kitchen keepsakes

O n es i d eo ft h ei s l a n di su s e da sab r e a k f a s tbar, so Deana can chatto the family whilecooking. In the winter,the wood-burningstove keeps the large
space warm. ‘It gives
an extra-cosy feel tothe room,’ says Deana
Deana and Michael Emerson
have been transforming
their home in Derbyshiresince they bought it 11 yearsago when their two girlswere young, but had put
off the kitchen renovation until recently. ‘Ourold kitchen wasn’t somewhere we’d all hangout together,’ says Deana. ‘So when it came tomaking our new kitchen work for us, we knewwe would have to extend out into the sidereturn and garden to create a space with anadjoining open-plan living area.’
Although the house is just 20 years old, it
was built using reclaimed stone from an oldShefﬁeld mill. To ensure that the kitchen felt inkeeping with the rest of the house, the coupleopted for traditional-style units. They alsoreused the stone and windows from the originalkitchen walls, so the new extension would feellike it has always been part of the property.
Having waited so long, the couple resolved
not to sacriﬁce anything on their wish list. Tokeep costs down, they did some of the workthemselves. Together, they ripped out the oldkitchen, Michael project-managed the buildand did the electrics, and Deana did the tiling.
‘The new kitchen is the heart of our home,’
says Deana. ‘We can be cooking while the girlsare watching TV at the end of the room, orfriends are having a drink at the breakfast bar.It has transformed how we use our home. Thereisn’t a thing that we’d change about it.’

Hannah and Pete
restored the original
fireplace in the formerbedroom and found
as h o w e re n c l o s u r eto fit into the alcove When Hannah and Pete
Philipson bought their
terraced home, theywere happy to sacrifice
one of their four
bedrooms for a bigger
bathroom. ‘The fourth bedroom seemed a longway from the other upstairs rooms at the endof a corridor,’ says Hannah. ‘There was a tinydated bathroom with a bath and basin, anda separate loo next door.’ The couple decidedthey’d knock the rooms together, stealing spacefrom the old bathroom for a laundry room, too.
When it came to the design, Hannah’s eye
for detail and creative flair were invaluable.‘We wanted a timeless feel, as it had to suitthe age of our house,’ she says. ‘I spent a lot  of time researching Victorian bathrooms,
getting inspiration from magazines and usingPinterest to narrow down the look.’
As she’d always wanted a freestanding bath,
Hannah splashed out on a beautiful cast-iron
design. To add to the character feel, she soughtout period-style fittings, covered an old chair
in grain sacking and hung up vintage mirrors.‘The hardest part was finding antique brass
fittings,’ she says. ‘I hunted down the taps andshower I wanted, but couldn’t find a budget looor basin without a chrome flush or plug hole, so
the builders sanded them down, sprayed them
gold and aged them with grate polish. The bestbargain was the £50 vintage Singer sewing-
machine stand. It was damaged, but we restored
it and now it’s a fantastic vanity unit.’

If safety issues have put you off the
idea of a fireworks party in the past,
these are the basics you need to know
for a stress- and problem-free do.
1BE BONFIRE-SAVVY
Build your bonfire a safe distance 
(atleast 18m) from houses, trees,
hedges, fences and sheds. Don’t use
petrol or paraffin to light it – domestic
firelighters are a safer option – and
check for hibernating hedgehogs
first. While a bonfire is a good
opportunity to burn scrap wood or
garden waste, never burn tins of
paint, tyres, batteries, foam-filled
furniture, aerosols or used fireworks. 
2BUY THE RIGHT FIREWORKS
Make sure you buy fireworks
that are intended for garden use(Category 2) and look for the BritishStandard number BS7114. ‘Garden’fireworks still require a spectator
distance of at least 5–8m, so if your
plot is smaller than that, go to a
public display instead.
3PREPARE PROPERLY
Store the fireworks in a metal box
with a lid before and during your
display, and never keep fireworks in
your pocket. Read the instructions for Get friends and neighbours together for an easy-going evening of ﬁreworks and food
FEATURE HEATHER YOUNG PHOTOGRAPH NARRATIVES/RACHEL WHITING 
ILLUSTRATIONS EMMA JACKSON THINGSTODO
THISMONTHNovember
Diga shallow pit and
surround it with bricks or
large stones (this will stop
the ﬁre from spreading) HOW TO BUILD THE PERFECT BONFIRE
Arrange tinder (dry leaves,
grass, bark, and twigs) into
a bundle, then place it in
the centre of the pit Build a tepee above it using
kindling sticks of increasing
size. Leave an opening for
the wind to fan the ﬂamesCreate a larger tepee
around the kindling using
fuel wood (branches the
width of your forearm)Light the tinder and fan
if necessary. As the
tepee burns, feed the ﬁre
with more fuel woodthe fireworks before your event, and
then again before lighting each one
– have a torch to hand if necessary.
4HAVE A DESIGNATED
FIREWORK LIGHTER
Make one person responsible for the
lighting of all fireworks, to keep the
display controlled. Make sure they
don’t drink too much! They shouldlight fireworks one at a time, usinga taper held at arm’s length. Never
return to a lit firework, or throw them.
5PRACTISE SAFE SPARKLING
Adults should tell children to hold
sparklers at arm’s length and not run
with them or wave them near anyone.
They should then light them, before
handing them to the children (over-
fives only). Get anyone who wants to have a sparkler to wear gloves, and
supply a bucket of water or sand for
putting sparklers in, hot end down,
when they’re spent. Avoid dressing
yourself or your children in flowingclothes, which could catch light.
6KNOW WHAT TO DO IN  AN EMERGENCY
Read up on basic first aid for coolingand protecting a burn (visit sja.org.uk), and have emergency numbers 
to hand, just in case.
7AND FINALLY…
Everyone knows this, but it’s easy
toforget in all t he excitem ent: make
sure you keep pets safe indoors with
allthe doors and windows shut, and
curtains or blinds drawn to muffle 
the noise of fireworks. 
| 152 NOVEMBER 2015 housetohome.co.uk/idealhomemagazineTomake your bonfire
easier to light,
collect kindling and
wood beforehand so
it has time to dry outTip‘Waterproof your fireworks
even if rain isn’t forecast –
cover each firework either with
plastic bags or clingfilm’

Treat it as soon as possible with
a special lawn feed to help the grass
recover after a summer of wear and
tear. Some lawn fertilisers will both
strengthen the roots and kill moss
for a healthier lawn come spring.
Give it one last mow before winter.
Grass continues to grow as long
a s t h e t e m p e r a t u r e i s a b o v e 5˚C, s oraise the cut to winter height, around
25% higher than in the summer
months, and mow before frosts arrive.
Rake up fallen leaves throughout
autumn – fallen leaves and debris
can trap moisture, encourage diseaseand turn your lawn yellow.
Keep off the grass if it’s frosty 
or wet to prevent damage.
PROTECT PLANTS
Cut back perennials once the
foliage has died back and mulch
around the remaining ‘crown’ withstraw, bark chips or fallen leaves.
Digup and store tender perennials,
such as dahlias and gladioli, that
won’t survive hard freezes. When
digging, be careful not to damage 
the plant’s tuber or corm.PREPARE THE GARDEN  
FOR WINTER
Put your garden to bed with some tender loving care and it’ll 
bounce back in spring, whatever the weather throws at it
FEATURE KAREN BRAY PHOTOGRAPHS GAP PHOTOSWrap plants in pots in fleece, bubble
wrap or coconut matting – their roots
aremore exposed to cold than if they
were planted in the ground. Wrap
the pot itself, and the plant as well if
it’san exotic or half-hardy, and group
pots together in a sheltered spot

Cover garden furniture or move it
under cover. Take outdoor cushions
indoors – they can develop mildew 
if stored in a shed or garage.
Treat hardwood tables and chairs
with a protective oil, such as Ronseal
Garden Furniture Protector, £13.64
for 750ml, B&Q.
Brush and wash plastic, resin and
metal furniture, and protect it with 
awaterproof cover over winter.
Clean and oil the metal parts
of tools to prevent rusting beforeputting them away in a shed. Hang
large tools on a rack to save space.
PREPARE FOR THE WEATHER
Check your shed and replace torn
roof felt. Lock the windows and door.
Stock up on salt or grit to scatter
onto icy paths and paving.
Usean oil-based stain on wooden
fences and structures to keep the
wood supple and allow it to ‘breathe’,
sothat rain can evaporate without
causing shrinkage or swelling.
Check exterior walls of your house
forcracks and get them fixed as soon
aspossible. If water gets in and
freezes, it’ll widen the crack.
Unblock airbricks to allow air to
flow freely beneath your property –
poor ventilation can lead to damp
timbers, which are susceptible to rot. CREATE AN
INDOOR GARDEN
A terrarium will give you
greenery all year round
1PICK A POT Choose an
open terrarium for drought-
loving plants, or a closed one
for moisture-loving varieties.
2M A K EAB A S E Line it with
gravel and aquatic charcoal,
then a layer of potting compost.
3ARRANGE PLANTS Embed
two or three slow-growing
plants in the compost, not letting
the leaves touch the sides of theterrarium. Fill gaps with bark chips, 
lichen, moss and stones.
4WATER SPARINGLY
Mist the leaves and glass to
clean off any soil. Do not seal the
container until the moisture has
evaporated. Make sure an open
terrarium doesn’t totally dry out.
5TAKE CARE OF IT Place your
terrarium in good light but not
in direct sunlight. If it’s closed, air the

QWHAT EXACTLY IS IT?
Although mindfulness is the
l
atest buzzword, it’s actually been
around for thousands of years. Based
on ancient Buddhist meditationpractices and breathing exercises, it isan awareness of what is taking placein the present moment. The rise in thepopularity of mindfulness can be putdown to the growing body of evidencepointing to its health benefits – in thelast 10 years, it has been prescribedto thousands of NHS patients to helpbeat anxiety, depression and stress.
QWHY SHOULD I DO IT?
If you find yourself racing from
ta
sk to task and feeling frazzled, then
mindfulness could be the answer. Thebasic practices are easy to carry outand can take less than 10 minutes. Aswell as helping reduce stress levels, itoffers the opportunity to get to knowyourself better, so you’re less likelyto focus on the negatives and will getbetter at dealing with your emotions.  
QHOW DO I GET STARTED?The Headspace app offers a
gr 
eat introduction to mindfulness with
T a k e 1 0–ap r ogramme of 10-minute
practices to be carried out every dayfor 10 days while you’re trying to form the habit of incorporating mindfulnessinto your day. No equipment is needed– simply start by sitting in a quiet,comfortable place where you won’t bedisturbed. It could be helpful to picka certain time of day that you alwayspractise, as this type of continuity canhelp with habit-forming.
QWHAT SHOULD I DO?Breathing exercises are at the
h 
eart of mindfulness. Simply close
your eyes, then take deep breaths
from your belly and focus on theinhalation and exhalation, noticing therise and fall of your chest. Breathe inslowly for a count of 10, then out forthe same length of time. Repeat this atleast three times. It doesn’t matter ifyour mind wanders – some days you’llbe more distracted than others – justlet the thoughts drift through yourmind, then bring your attention backto your breathing. Aim to do this for10 minutes every morning when youwake up, then for a minute every houror so if you can during the day.
QCAN I TAKE IT FURTHER?
If you’ve got 10 minutes or longer
to
spare, try what’s called body-scan
meditation to become more aware of
your thoughts and sensations. It’s best FEATURE HEATHER YOUNGdone lying down – perhaps in bedat the start or end of the day. Focus
your attention on the top of your head,
then slowly move onto each section ofyour body down to your toes, thinking about how each part feels. Greaterself-awareness can relieve tension andencourage peace of mind.
QCAN I DO IT WHEN I’M OUT?
Walking m editation is an
excellent way to pay more attentionto the present moment while you’reon the go. Take a few deep breathsand make yourself more aware of yourenvironment and how you’re feeling.As you walk, focus your thoughts onyour feet hitting the ground and theswing of your leg as you take a step.Expand your awareness to what’s aroundyou, taking in the sights, smells andnoises as you walk. 
QW H A TI FI ’ MT O OB U S Y ?
If you’re going at a hundred miles
an
hour, you can grab any opportunity
to be more mindful. If you’re waiting
in a queue, instead of getting impatient,slow down your breathing and focuson it. Identify times of the day when youtend to zone out, such as when you’redriving or doing the washing up, andbring your attention back to what you’redoing, taking proper notice of the sights,smells and sounds around you.

ACERS
Also called Japanese maples,
these deciduous trees orshrubs are loved for theircolourful foliage. They comein either a domed or uprightshape, and vary in size,reaching from 1.2m to 8mhigh, with the smallervarieties ideal for containers.
HOW TO GROW While acers
s
uit all types of soil, if it’s clay,
you’ll need to add some organic
matter to aid drainage. You shouldplant them in autumn, whilethe soil is still warm. Red andpurple-leaved cultivars colourup best in some sunlight, whilegreen-leaved varieties can toleratefull sun, but really all acers do bestin dappled shade. Shelter themfrom cold winds and late frosts  to protect delicate foliage.

whack
up the central heating, give up
drying our laundry outside and batten
down the hatches for winter, but did
you know having damp clothes and
dry air inside our homes can causehealth issues? The solution is to keephumidity levels at an optimum of
between 40% and 60%. Low humidity,
which brings on anything from wrinklesto eczema, can be treated with a
humidifier, whereas high humidity, in
which allergy triggers such as mould and mildew can thrive, is tackled witha dehumidifier. There are also gadgetsthat monitor air quality and warn us ifit has reached an unhealthy level.

Then, when it’s ready, analarm sounds and your toast automatically rises upin one smooth motion. The glass is revolutionary,getting almost twice as hot as a standard wireelement for faster and more even browning,  and it can also defrost and reheat.

personalise it. You can choose a black or

10 metallic accents. For an extra £24.99,you can also buy a protective flip shellthatcovers the screen.

dropped it in the loo will be relieved
to hear that the new G is IPX7 rated –
in other words, it’s waterproof to a depth of 1m for up to half an hour. The 5in
screen is tough and scratch-resistant, too.
3Impressive photos The cameras are
a big improvement on the old Moto

TS3SLOW COOK
FOR TASTE ANDTENDERNESS
Re-create your Gastropub favourites
with that Seventies staple, the
slow cooker. Cooking on a low
heat for a long time (often for
eight hours or more) will turn
cheaper cuts of meat into tenderdishes – experiment with pulled
pork or braised beef cheeks, and
you’ll see what I mean. Countertop
slow cookers have limited capacity,
so you might prefer a range cooker 
or built-in oven with a slow-cook
programme. Top chefs favour warming 
drawers, due to their more precise
temperature controls – even I managed to
make the most delicious Parmesan crisps in one.
5LOCK IN
FLAVOUR WITHSOUS-VIDE
You’ll need to invest in the right kit, but
if you want to impress with the most
succulent steaks and the creamiest
crème brûlées, try sous-vide cooking.
Meaning ‘under vacuum’, sous-vide
involves sealing food in an airtight
bag using a vacuum packer, then
placing it in a steam oven or water
bath to cook. MasterChef 2011 winner
Tim Anderson is a big fan of the
method, which preserves the ﬂavours,
juices, nutrients and textures lost in
conventional cooking. ‘Try carrots – oh
man!’ he says. ‘Chuck them in a vacuum
bag with some butter, brown sugar and
salt. They’ll take much longer to cook than 
usual, but will taste amazing.’4INVEST IN A
‘SUPER BLENDER’
These powerful machines
can make the most velvetyemulsions and thesmoothest of soups, andtake on tasks that regularblenders just can’t handle,like milling ﬂour andblending fresh nut butters.Deliciously Ella says that her

Always place lit candles well away from foliage, furniture, curtains and soft furnishings,and always out of draughts Keep candles out of reach of children and pets  Never leave 
a burning candle unattended Keep candles away from hair and clothing  
Always place candles upright in suitable holders that can’t easily
fall over  Always be sure that candles are properly extinguishedBE
