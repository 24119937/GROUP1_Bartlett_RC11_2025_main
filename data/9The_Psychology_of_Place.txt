Readings on the Psychology 
of Place 
In the World Library of Psychologists series, international experts present career-long 
collections of what they judge to be their most interesting publications – extracts 
from books, key articles, research ﬁndings and practical and theoretical contributions. 
In this fascinating volume, Professor David Canter reﬂects on a career that has 
earned him an international reputation as one of the U.K.’s most eminent applied 
social psychologists and a pioneer in the ﬁeld of environmental psychology, through a 
selection of papers that illustrate one of the foundational themes of his research career: 
the psychology of place. Split into four parts, each with a new introduction written 
by the author, the book provides insights into theories, methods and applications 
of place psychology. Covering a range of publications from early research in the 
1960s up to recent explorations, this volume provides the unfolding research that 
elaborates this seminal theory, ofering rich perspectives on how places gain their 
signiﬁ cance and meaning. 
Featuring specially written commentary by the author contextualizing the 
selections and providing an intimate overview of his career, this collection of key 
publications ofers a unique and compelling insight into decades of ground-breaking 
work, making it an essential resource for all those engaged or interested in the study 
of places. 
David Canter is one of the U.K.’s most eminent applied social psychologists, being 
one of the few to be appointed as Honorary Fellow of the British Psychological 
Society and having been elected as a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences, the 
American Psychological Association and the Royal Society of Medicine. Although 
he is internationally known for his development of the discipline of Investigative 
Psychology, bringing scientiﬁc precision to ‘of ender proﬁling’, his earlier and 
continuing work centres on the development of Architectural/environmental 
psychology, establishing the well-respected  Journal of Environmental Psychology in 
1980 and the International Association for People-Environment Studies (IAPS). He 
has worked as a management consultant to major U.K. companies on risk reduction, 
amalgamations and brieﬁng for new building complexes and has given advice to 
government inquiries into disasters. He wrote and presented a six-part documentary 
series,  Mapping Murder, which is also published as a widely read book. He is Emeritus 
Professor at the University of Liverpool, U.K.

World Library of Psychologists 
The World Library of Psychologists series celebrates the important contributions to 
psychology made by leading experts in their individual ﬁelds of study. Each scholar 
has compiled a career-long collection of what they consider to be their ﬁ nest pieces: 
extracts from books, journals, articles, major theoretical and practical contributions, 
and salient research ﬁ ndings. 
For the ﬁrst time ever the work of each contributor is presented in a single vol-
ume so readers can follow the themes and progress of their work and identify the 
contributions made to, and the development of, the ﬁ elds themselves. 
Each book in the series features a specially written introduction by the contribu-
tor giving an overview of their career, contextualizing their selection within the 
development of the ﬁ eld, and showing how their thinking developed over time.

Preface 
By the 1980s, a small but dedicated community of academics and some practitioners 
were studying psychological aspects of people’s interactions with their surroundings. 
As explored in my article (reproduced here) describing  architectural psychology, the 
origins of these studies had been the practical concerns about designing buildings 
so that they were more efective for their users. But by the 1980s, the interest in 
human experience and use of their physical contexts had broadened. Architectural 
psychology had been subsumed under the wide-ranging umbrella of environmen-
tal psychology. This latter area is evolving to focus on the important issues of hu-
man response to climate change and how people may be persuaded to modify their 
environmentally related activities. 
The emerging focus on this ‘green environmental psychology’ led to a reduced 
interest in the earlier research, carried out during the last three decades of the twen-
tieth century. Those studies, and contributions to many aspects of design, were 
overshadowed by the pressing need to connect with behavioural aspects of the many 
environmental challenges. However, in recent years, there has been a reawakening 
of interest in those earlier studies. This is demonstrated, for example, by the book 
by Lily  Bernheimer (2017 ) and, most recently, the book by my former student and 
later colleague, Ian Donald (2022 ). That reawakening has encouraged a reappraisal 
of the signiﬁcance of the earlier research. It is contributing to understanding how 
those psychological processes underlying human transactions with the physical envi-
ronment are at the heart of any climate-relevant behaviour. 
One particular aspect of the early research has not been ignored. This is the study 
of ‘place’ as an aspect of experience, as distinct from a mere space or location. This 
was ﬁrst elaborated in my book  The Psychology of Place ( Canter, 1977 ), the introduc-
tory summary of which is reproduced here. There has since been a great outpouring 
of studies and publications around the theory and applications of this way of think-
ing about places. It is, therefore, appropriate to bring together in the present volume 
a set of earlier publications that elaborate the details of this seminal theory. These 
earlier works are complemented by more recent studies which build directly on that 
initial research. 
Most of these publications emerged in a pre-digital age. Consequently, they are 
not as readily available as subsequent publications. Furthermore, many of them were 
published in books of readings or relatively obscure journals because that was where

Preface xi 
the interest was in the topics. This also make them more difcult to access. There-
fore, bringing them together here provides a valuable resource for those who wish to 
understand the origins and engage directly with the many strands of  The Psychology 
of Place.

Part 1 
Origins of the theory 
of place 
At the age of 21, I embarked on a PhD with the Pilkington Research Unit in the 
Department of Building Science at the University of Liverpool (although my PhD 
was registered and of  cially supervised in the Department of Psychology). The topic 
of the PhD, awarded in 1969, was ‘The Psychological Implications of Ofce Size’.1 
This was formulated within a simple-minded experimental psychology tradition. 
The assumption was that the larger the ofce, the more distractions, so the poorer the 
performance of ofce workers in those rooms. This was a ‘determinist’ assumption 
about the impact of the environment on behaviour. As illustrated in the 1968 article, 
reproduced here from the  Architects’ Journal, the results challenged that assumption. 
In the tradition of ﬁeld experiments, I got people to complete clerical tests in 
dif erent-sized ofces. These varied from rooms with only a few people in to those 
with over 100 in. Some of the ofce workers were tested in the ofce in which they 
normally worked. Others were tested in ofces of a diferent size from their usual 
room. To my confusion, I found no change on the test scores for people tested in dif-
ferent ofces but a clear indication that the larger the ofce in which they normally 
worked, the poorer their scores. After much head scratching, I realized that I was 
identifying something about the sorts of people who worked in ofces of dif erent 
sizes. I was not measuring the direct impact of the environment on their performance. 
This turned my determinist assumptions on their head. For one reason or another, 
people of difering clerical abilities seemed to be drifting towards ofces that housed 
diferent numbers of workers. In the early 1960s, when my data were collected, 
there were high levels of employment. People could choose where they wanted to 
work. Therefore, one assumption could be that people who liked working in large 
open ofces would accept jobs there. Those who did not like that possibility would 
not. There were also likely to be status issues about who ended up in which ofces. 
These considerations led the awareness that people make use of buildings in relation 
to their understanding of the possibilities these ofer. This understanding relies to 
some extent on the users’, or potential users’, interpretation of any particular physi-
cal context – in a word, the ‘meaning’ of that environment. 
Remarkably (I think, for the young researcher I was then), I did indicate in this 
ﬁrst paper, which was presented as an illustration of the possibilities for research in 
architecture, that there was a need ‘to build theoretical models which explain, in 
DOI: 10.4324/9781003313052-1

2 Origins of the theory of place 
detail, the relationships between the disciplines of architecture and that of psychol-
ogy’ (page 881). The subsequent quarter of a century of my research struggled with 
aspects of this possibility. 
The starting point for developing ‘theoretical models’ was to explore what ar-
chitecture is for. This may initially seem obvious, but there is a crucial distinction 
between civil engineering and architecture. I did develop the consideration of this 
distinction a few years later ( Canter, 1977 ), but the initial idea was to explore the 
functions of architecture. The need for an account of that exploration was also pub-
lished in the Architects’ Journal and reprinted in the present volume. 
It draws attention to three ways in which buildings function: 
• as a ﬁlter – keeping nasty things (like noise) out and letting good things (such as 
daylight) in; 
• as a social facilitator – providing the spatial opportunities to house various activi-
ties and the potential relationship between those activities; and 
• as a signiﬁer – providing possibilities for the interpretation of the meaning of 
buildings and the spaces they house. 
This latter point was rather contentious at the time because there was still the myth 
enshrined in the slogan ‘form follows function’, somehow indicating that the design 
of a building was merely a reﬂection of the uses to which it was to be put. However, 
once it was acknowledged that one function of a building is to indicate what those 
purposes are with all the cultural and status overtones that implies, then the idea that 
a building was just an engineering project, ‘a machine for living in’ as Le Corbusier 
famously announced, is no longer sustainable. 
The implication of this perspective is summarized in that 1970 paper as the 
following: 
building type categorisation is often inadequate. 
For example, modern ofce buildings are . . . the same inside and out. Yet 
what goes on in them . . . are quite diferent. The head ofce of an organi-
sation making a specialised product has quite a diferent hierarchy from, say, 
an insurance company. A cellular block of ofces might be right for one 
but not for the other. 
(page 301) 
I like to think that this perspective fed into the debates emerging in architecture in 
the early 1970s, about approaches to building design, and the need to recognize the 
meanings that buildings carried. This was articulated by the architect and architec-
tural commentator Charles Jenks (1977 ). He expropriated a concept from discus-
sions in English literature of ‘post-modernism’. Most importantly, he argued that 
post-modern architecture has a ‘language’. 
What Jenks did not do was to take the next step and recognize that languages 
have listeners who may or may not understand what is being said. My discovery of

3 
Origins of the theory of place 
what people brought to their interactions with buildings was opening up as much 
a perspective that saw them as agents, not passive users. The rather neat title of the 
paper (reproduced here) that I gave at the legendary 1969 Dalandhui conference 
( Canter, 1970 ), ‘Should we treat building users as subjects of objects?’, encapsulated 
a debate which resonates still today. One intriguing study in my paper, which never 
found a more conventional journal outlet, was the consideration of where students 
at the Architectural Association, London, School of Architecture chose to sit, in 
a seminar series I gave, when I arranged the layout of the room in dif erent ways. 
Quite remarkably, they sat at the front when it was a semi-circular layout but at 
the back when laid out in straight rows. In those late 1960s days, the AA (as it was 
known) was somewhat radical. I still remember that the babies taken to my seminar 
series were not as great a distraction as the dogs brought along. In this context, the 
reading of the nature of the particular seminar was clearly derived from the layout 
of the room with the consequent decision of whether to attend the event and, if so, 
where to sit. 
It was from this consideration of how people read a room that it occurred to me 
that the context in which a person is seen could carry meanings about that person. 
The study for which I supervised an architect, Roger Wools (reprinted here), did 
indeed demonstrate the power of the context on judgements of people. This idea 
was elaborated many years later by Sam  Gosling (2008 ) in his popular book. This 
idea has subsequently been reﬂected in various television game shows in which 
people have to guess who the owner is of homes presented to them. Sam’s attempt 
to participate in such guesses were often not very successful, demonstrating the 
complexity of these relationships. A follow-up study I did with videos instead of still 
photographs gave such complex results that it was yet another interesting study that 
never got published. 
By the mid-1970s, I was seeking to broaden the reach of my work. The previ-
ous focus on buildings and rooms seemed to me to be an unnecessary limitation. 
A remarkable one-year Leverhulme fellowship to Japan had opened my eyes to 
the relevance of psychological considerations to larger environmental contexts. The 
ways in which we build up our understanding of cities had intrigued me as I started 
to learn how to navigate around Tokyo. I was, therefore, curious about the accuracy 
with which people generate ideas of where things are, especially how far away they 
are. From my background in laboratory studies of perception, it occurred to me that 
in a city where locations cannot be immediately seen, there must be some internal 
representation. How did this relate to the representation of maps? A very straight-
forward study suggested itself, examining the estimates people made of distances 
(reproduced here). 
By this stage, I had started to use a form of statistical analysis that has proven pow-
erful ever since. This is the representation of relationships as distances in a notional 
space. However, in the case of distance estimation, it was possible to represent aver-
age distant estimates as distances in a notional space. That representation could be 
compared with other representations. In the complex city layout of Tokyo, there is a 
public transport system that is represented as a circle, but on an actual map, it is much 
more elliptic. It was, therefore, rather interesting to see that the spatial representation

4 Origins of the theory of place 
of distance estimates was much closer to a circle that an ellipse. This really paved the 
way for recognizing that places are as much mental representations as geographical 
ones. Writing my widely cited book,  The Psychology of Place, was a journey for me, 
exploring the psychological implications of places. The introductory summary of 
that book is reproduced here. 
The widely quoted and elaborated framework developed in that book from a va-
riety of research sources is that places are aspects of experience that combine physi-
cal, conceptual and action facets. These three are always present, helping to indicate 
what a place is. The implications of this triumvirate have been developed through 
theories and practice.

Architectural psychology 
David Canter 
Architectural psychology (known, unsurprisingly, in German as Architekturpsy-
chologie) is an area of social research and practice that considers the implications 
for human experience, thoughts and actions of interactions with the built and 
natural environment. Its initial heyday was in the late 1960s and early 1970s with 
a seminal conference in Scotland in 1969 ( Canter, 1970 ) and another in Australia 
in 1974 ( Canter, 1974 ) and a book of original research the same year ( Canter and 
Lee, 1974 ). The term fell into disuse but is making something of a comeback in 
the 2020s, with a number of design and research groups using the term to describe 
their activities. There was a psychology and architecture conference at the Univer-
sity of Texas in 2016 1 and a conference using the term was planned in Germany 
for 2021. 
The area of study emerged as the Second World War came to an end. At that 
time, there was a growing democratization of politics combined with awareness of 
changes in society. This meant people in authority could no longer decide for the 
population at large. The growth of the social sciences also reﬂected a move towards 
a more systematic understanding of individual and social behaviour of relevance to 
many areas of decision making. Those in power could no longer be relied on to 
understand how people lived. In architecture, this was mirrored by a move towards 
a more scientiﬁ c basis for design decision making, reﬂected in the U.K. in the 1951 
Festival of Britain which foregrounded the contribution of science and engineering 
to modern society, including many aspects of building design. 
Across Europe, there were government-funded projects, starting in the 1950s, to 
provide guidelines for the massive building programme after the destruction of the 
Second World War. In the U.K., there were initially studies for housing ( Morris, 
1961), then ofces, shops and railway premises, then schools and hospitals. These 
studies, typically conducted by civil servants and sociologists, tended to focus on ap-
propriate levels of spatial provision for diferent activities. Other early studies were 
carried out mainly by physicists and engineers. They examined aspects of thermal 
comfort, noise annoyance (e.g.,  Grifths and Langdon, 1968 , who were actually ex-
perimental psychologists) and the implications of lighting levels, especially daylight 
penetration into homes and ofces. Much of this work related directly to the impact 
of the physical environment on productivity ( Oborne and Gruneberg, 1983 ) .

The scientiﬁc trend in architecture gave rise to research units, such as that funded 
by the plate glass manufacturer, Pilkington, who set up the Pilkington Research 
Unit, initially studying daylight penetration, then ofce design ( Manning, 1965 ) 
and, subsequently, schools. This then developed into the multidisciplinary Building 
Performance Research Unit ( Markus et al., 1972 ). A Europe-wide research associa-
tion grew out of these studies, the International Association for People Environment 
Studies (IAPS), with the rather more elegant Australian acronym PAPER (People 
and the Physical Environment Research). 
The origins in the U.S. in the late 1950s and early 1960s were requests from 
architects to psychiatrists and psychologists for guidance on the design of buildings 
which housed people that the designers considered to be very dif erent from them-
selves, notably psychiatric patients and children. An early account by the psychiatrist 
Osmond (1957) introduced the then rather novel idea that the function of a psychi-
atric ward should be the basis for design. This was the start of a stream of research 
that laid the foundations for architectural psychology in the U.S. This gave rise to 
the Environmental Design Research Association (EDRA) which is still active today. 
These developments were encouraged by three early publications from the U.S. 
which had paved the way for the consideration of the spatial aspects of human activi-
ties and experience with architectural implications,  Lynch’s (1960 )  The Image of the 
City, Sommer’s (1969 )  Personal Space: The Behavioral Basis of Design and Rapoport’s 
(1969 )  House Form and Culture. 
The area of study broadened out to cover aspects of landscape experience and the 
meaning of building forms. Consequently, although the term ‘architectural psychol-
ogy’ was widely used, many of those involved were not psychologists and the areas 
of study went far beyond those aspects of the environment over which architects 
have control. This has included somewhat limited studies of the psychology of ar-
chitects and architectural decision making. 
Not long after the designation of the existence of architectural psychology 
through conferences in the U.S. and the U.K., the label environmental psychol-
ogy was introduced in the U.S. with the establishment in New York of an envi-
ronmental psychology doctoral programme. Although much of the early research 
under this umbrella dealt directly with aspects of buildings, the promotional power 
of U.S. researchers led to the term nudging the label architectural psychology out of 
common use. With the advent of the ‘environmental movement’ and the growing 
awareness of a climate crisis, many social scientists became involved in what might 
be called ‘green environmental psychology’. In many cases, this is an aspect of so-
cial psychology dealing with attitudes to climate change and related actions such as 
recycling and being more ‘environmentally friendly’. With that broadening of the 
meaning of environmental psychology, architectural psychology became identiﬁ ed 
as a particular area of the wider ﬁeld. This does add some confusion because there 
are important epistemological diferences between green environmental psychology 
and architectural psychology. 
From its earliest days, there were theoretical explorations of the ways in which 
people interact with their surroundings. This is often confusingly couched in ques-
tions about the impact of buildings on human actions and experiences. These

7 
Architectural psychology 
questions are based on the assumption of what is known as ‘architectural determin-
ism’. This is the belief that buildings directly shape what people think, feel and do. A 
commonly cited quotation from Winston Churchill in his discussion of the rebuild-
ing of the Houses of Parliament after being damaged during the Second World War 
captures the complexity of even an elementary view of the inﬂuence of architecture: 
‘We shape our buildings, and after that, they shape us’. The interactive nature il-
lustrated by Churchill point to the limits of buildings’ determining human actions. 
Many studies show that, except at the extremes of environmental conditions, people 
are remarkably ﬂexible in their response to the physical environment. Therefore, 
more complex theories have emerged that explore what people bring to their use 
and experience of buildings as much as what inﬂuence buildings have on them. 
A central theory to emerge as part of the move away from a strongly determinist 
perspective draws on the concept of ‘place’ ( Canter, 1977 ). This is proposed as an 
aspect of experience in which physical, social, emotional and behavioural facets are 
all combined. The central premise is that all actions and experiences are spatial and 
all spaces carry implications for actions and experiences. In its most extreme form, 
this is embedded in a phenomenological perspective that accepts ‘being-in-place’ as 
a wholistic aspect of living (recently reviewed by one of the leading thinkers of this 
approach,  Seamon, 2018 ). This has its origins in the musings of the French ‘philoso-
pher’Bachelard (1958 ). Although, intriguingly, many geographers seem to have got-
ten bored with map-making, and this phenomenological viewpoint now typically 
dominates areas of social/human geography (e.g.,  Malpas, 1999 ). 
One particular strand of theory building has been the exploration of the mean-
ing of places. This has taken on the form of elaborating how and what meanings 
buildings stimulate. This connected with an emerging interest in semiotics and 
was given impetus by Jencks’s declaration of the existence of a ‘post-modern ar-
chitecture’ ( Jencks, 1977 ). As long as the dominant style in architecture followed 
the (rather ambiguous) slogan ascribed to Le Corbusier of ‘form follows function’, 
the idea that buildings carried meaning was something of an anathema. Once that 
idea was undermined, there was room for consideration of what the signiﬁ cance 
of physical forms might be. Early work brought together by architects  Broadbent 
(1980 ) and  Rapoport (1982 ) provided a variety of perspectives in how buildings 
generate meanings. The meaning of places is still an active area of scholarship ( Cas-
tello, 2010 ). 
Research into architectural psychology takes on many diferent forms ( Groat and 
Wang, 2002 ). In general, it eschews laboratory studies because they provide such a 
distinct context that all that can be studied there is the laboratory experience itself. 
The research design, regarded as the golden standard in experimental research, of the 
double-blind controlled trial makes little sense when studying people’s experience of 
buildings. They always have a related reason for being there, a role in the building, 
which cannot be readily simulated for the purpose of research. The practical and 
ethical challenges of randomly assigning people to diferent physical environment 
also limits the use of this research design. 
However, the ease of showing people pictures of places and asking them to react 
to those images has nonetheless provided a trend in publications which has been

8 David Canter 
enhanced with the facility provided by digital media, notably videos and virtual real-
ity representations. Surveys and various forms of interviews, which relate directly to 
architectural experiences, have tended to be the favoured form of research. Within 
the phenomenological tradition, these interviews have usually been open-ended 
explorations of direct experience, often bordering on autobiography or descriptive 
journalism. 
The inﬂ uence of architectural psychology is dif  cult to pinpoint, in part because 
of the amorphous nature of architecture and the many diferent stakeholders, such 
as owners, planning authorities, managers and (rarely) potential users, who inﬂ uence 
architectural decision making. However, the ways in which architectural education 
and the fashion for grand architecture has changed over the past half-century must, 
to some extent, have been inﬂuenced by the debates in architectural psychology. 
These have included the recognition that people bring their own perspective and 
aspirations to the use of any buildings and that the idea of ‘function’ in architecture 
carries a complex mixture of psychological implications, an issue discussed directly 
in the early days of architectural psychology ( Canter, 1970 ). The involvement of 
potential users in the design of buildings, with all the beneﬁts that it brings, can also 
be seen as inﬂuenced by concepts and research drawn from architectural psychology.
