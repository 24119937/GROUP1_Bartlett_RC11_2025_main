+101 ways to play the perfect 
hostess... shopping guide, decor inspiration, midnight bites and cupcake love!The Ideal Home and Garden December 201 4  |  19 The winter sun is shining nice and bright, my balcony is full of blooms and  
I am beginning to enjoy the steaming hot cups of coffee. And as much as  I love lazing around my home this time of the year, I find my social diary  choc-a-bloc with invites ‚Äì some brunches, others barbecue evenings, and a bunch of  cocktail evenings. 
Entertaining during this time of the year is at its peak. And we recognise the need for you to play the perfect hostess each time. That‚Äôs why we have put together an extensive Party Guide guaranteed to take care of all your hosting needs ‚Äì from what to shop for and where, what to serve and how to set up your place in style ‚Äì it‚Äôs all here.
And whether you are planning to entertain indoors, or planning to take the party outdoors, say it with flowers. Take 
inspiration from our story Flower Art to know how you can make the most of this season of blooms.
With the new season setting in, it‚Äôs almost mandatory to get your home winter ready. And what is better than a splash 
of colour to perk up an otherwise grey season? No, don‚Äôt stop at just the paint can, though we have that bit sorted for you too in our Colour Code story. Wallpapers are the hottest (and the easiest) way to jazz up an otherwise mundane space. Take cue from our story Wall Art to zero down on the one that appeals to you the most.
And if you are looking to escape the hustle bustle of city life during your Christmas break, the rustic Laxman Sagar 
Resort in Rajasthan is for you. I have my heart set on this one. And for all you know, I might just be waiting for my Santa Claus to arrive somewhere in faraway Rajasthan this time.
Wishing you the best of festive times ahead.Merry Christmas!

√Å Good Earth continues to be my eternal 
favourite. This time it‚Äôs the bar accessories.
√Å The Elementto range of wallpapers are a unique blend  of charm and sophistication.MY PICKS: 20  |  Decemebr 2014  The Ideal Home and GardenA FRESH START
Vibration, colorful, and alive, 
that's what the TIHG  8th 
Anniversary Issue meant to me. It made all the more sense as I have very recently shifted into my own place and was just wondering about doing it up when I came across your issue. I just loved Bhavna Bhatnagar's blog "An Indian Summer", since I love using warm colours in my home. I am going to start incorporating many of these shades into my new home. Also, Trend-in and Haute on the web in this month's edition were helpful. I am eagerly waiting for the Spring/Summer issue of TIHG. Cheers to your team! 
Neha, Bangalore  INBOX
THE 8TH COLOUR 
My heartiest congratulations on 
completing eight stupendous years in quality journalism. TIHG is one periodical which always serves factory fresh, farm fresh reading material.  I called you the 8th Color of rainbow as I had never come across a better depiction & compilation of VIBGYOR like you did. And the 8th color to me is "Scintillating TIHG" which is capable of imbibing every color In It. Besides, you turned the Anniversary Issue into a Collector‚Äôs Edition through your coverage on the Masters of the Trade ‚Äì Designer Tales. 
Padma Jagdish, New Delhi
at tihg@nextgenpublishing.net! The 
best letter of the month wins a hamper worth `3,000 from Baaya Design - 
the folk art and home d√©cor store at Raghuvanshi mills in Lower Parel, Mumbai. The November hamper includes this Glass Tray - with folk art. So get writing now!

to us..NEWER AVENUES 
The Anniversary issue had some great 
features, the compilation broke all the previous records in terms of beauty, content and presentation. The par-excellence features included A Blissful Bath, Meal Junction, Peace of Mind, and The Furnished Room. However, I would rate Designer Tales as the Feature of the Month as it made an unprecedented read. The feature impressed me most.  We all relish many delicacies without knowing the hands who make it happen, and once you see them the taste gets doubled. These 8 Remarkable Designers opened the door of the Kitchen to allow us to have that feeling. Great read it was. B AJIT, New Delhi

VALUE ADDITION 
Y our 8th Anniversary Special Issue 
contained an "Eye opener tool" as well amidst ‚ÄòCooking Tools‚Äô , as till now I was under a self-satisfying presumption that my newly-modified kitchen is complete in all respects. However, you politely broke this misconception of mine and made my kitchen richer by educating with these new and useful Tools. Although they are inexpensive, they would help me to the priceless extent. Furthermore, A Blissful Bath and Shower Power will also be doing a great value addition to my washroom. I am going to have many things to flaunt in my next kitty party.

WINTER Soir√©e
MOOD LIGHT:  If you‚Äôve got the ambience right, you‚Äôve 
won half the battle. I‚Äôm convinced that my home 
looks its best when bathed in the soft forgiving glow of candles. Diffused light can raise the emotional temperatures in a room and is the perfect antidote to shake off those winter chills. My absolute favourite this season are these exquisite candle holders from Purple Turtles (http://thepurpleturtles.com/).Temperatures have been plummeting and we are taking 
the year end celebration indoors. A successful soir√©e not only calls for great company, scrumptious food and fl owing conversation and wine but also the perfect party 
d√©cor. With a little thought and planning, holiday hosting can be stress free with you being in control and playing the ‚Äúideal hostess‚Äù . Here is my list of must have party d√©cor, tips and tricks. 
Sruthi Singh
MAKE ROOM FOR MORE: Comfort is key while entertaining, so 
make sure you provide plentiful seating and perching options 
for your guests. A simple solution to this dilemma is to scatter

the perfect house party this season.

TRAY POWER : I just love the portable character of trays. 
They are the perfect alternative to a bar or table top. 
Style a sculptural pedestal with your favorite books and top it off with a tray and you have yourself an instant side table or mini bar! And if you are feeling crafty and are in the mood to experiment, make your own with supplies from Craftslane (http://craftslane.com/newProducts.php)PARTY FAVORS:  Don‚Äôt sweat over party favors. Floral 
arrangements put together for the party double as favors. 
At the end of the party, place a Chalkboard sign marked 
‚ÄúPlease Help Yourself‚Äù, a few waterproof candy bags and 
colour coordinated ribbons to cinch bags closed. This will 
leave the guests feeling special and making you the Queen 
of entertaining for going that extra mile.
COASTER INDULGENCE:  Using coasters not only makes things 
look elegant and fancy but also keeps the horrendous water rings on furniture at bay. So make sure you dig into your cache and round up all the coasters you‚Äôve got on hand and place them within the guests arm‚Äôs reach so that your furniture is safe. If you‚Äôre looking for something unique to serve as coasters, consider switching Jaipur blue pottery tiles for regular coasters or shop the Orissa pink stone coasters from Collective Craft (https://www.facebook.com/CollectiveCraft).

TEXTURAL DIALOGUE:  Whether you are serving things up 
the family-style or are planning on a formal sit down 
dinner, use your dining table to showcase your personal style. Don‚Äôt be afraid to use an idiosyncratic mix of colors, textures and patterns to give the space some depth, dimension and personality. I always like to add a desi touch to my d√©cor and believe in mixing and using what I have on hand. A combination of eco-friendly chattai style table runners, kantha style table mats and YLQWDJHEUDVV6LDP√ÅDWZDUHD√ÅHDPDUNHW√ÄQGGRWKHtrick for me and make it special for my guests. 
STOCK UP ON STALKS:  Flowers are an 
indispensable element in decorating my home 
for a fete!  They are a great way to bring in color 
and instantaneously perk up a space. Ditch the 
conventional vases and consider displaying your 
blooms in unconventional receptacles. ‚ÄúFound objects‚Äù 
from the kitchen cabinets such as vintage kettles and 
beer mugs, vinaigrette bottles, ceramic creamers,

conversation starters.
Gatherings and parties is all about spending time with 
your loved ones, creating memories and just having fun. I‚Äôm sure these party tips and tricks are going to keep you calm and help you party on!!!

Celebrating
Energy, power, and the dynamic relationships between animal and 
man are some of the themes that animate Deepak Shinde‚Äôs work.
Impressions: Benoy Sebastian
Deepak Shinde‚Äôs work is 
deeply rooted in his own 
experiences, through his journey of life. His paintings are a response to what he feels  are an outcome of varying events. Th e changing circumstances 
are depicted through a series of images refl  ecting the inherent 
constancy of the process of change. As an artist, Shinde believes there are three aspects to art:  the emotional, the intellectual and the aesthetic. His instincts, experiences and thoughts act as evolutionary elements in the production of art that reveal itself to the world in a blaze of colours, making his paintings a celebration of hues ‚Äì not in the thoughtlessly liberal sense but, rather, a celebration of the spirit within. Simple and spontaneous, his work has a distinctly rustic feel. Th  e 
two way movement in his work between the abstraction and the fi guration adds a celebratory 
dynamism and physicality to his canvases. His animal fi  gures - fi sh, monkeys, tigers, 
elephants, bulls, deer, fox, chameleons, parrots   with their gestures and movements and in their abstraction indicate a mythic representation of life processes. His canvases are temptingly pleasing, bathed as they are in a certain philosophical and primordial light.
Based on the testimony 
of Shinde‚Äôs paintings, human beings are driven principally by their passions; they become play things rather than the masters of their desires, with reason mulling over in excess the morning aft er. And what they 
accumulate, as they negotiate the treacherous currents of worldly experience, is a wry wisdom rather than a balance of  happiness.

conversation with the greens all 
around, ‚Äù shares Aditya. We entered the house only to the more unfolding of stories. With geometrical flooring pattern and a larger than life painting on the wall, the foyer took us to the living and dining area on the left. From modern and subtle to traditional and cozy, the living room is the heart of the house with a no-fuss mantra. ‚ÄúI wanted it simple and clean-lined, inviting a bit of glamour and loads of comfort, ‚Äù says Aditya. 
The huge floor to ceiling 
windows on the three sides are just perfect to highlight interior details. For a more sophisticated look, the family decided to go with white marbles, mop inlay work, Burma teak wood windows  and extra high ceilings. ‚ÄòThe d√©cor pieces in the entire  house are unique in one or the other way. ‚Äô The large antique wooden set in the living area is from Gujarat. The table is made of railway sleeper wood and the top is toughened glass  with steel frame. The other coffee table is sourced from Murano, Italy. TIHG loved the porcelain girl with body tattoos from Germany.

furniture are from The Furniture Republic. The basement of the house is used as an entertainment area complete with a snooker, table tennis, party area and a verandah all around. To avoid the typical basement look, Aditya decided to have large windows, potted plants and a water fountain. The furniture is sourced from Australia. The statement pieces are from Murano, Italy while the Italian leather chairs are hand painted by an artist in India. The wooden clocks are from Portugal. ‚ÄúFor a personal

A 19th century hunting lodge, Lakshman Sagar 
encapsulates centuries of history and age-old Marwar 
tradition. Built to host visiting noble families of Rajasthan 
and British emissaries for their hunting escapades, the lodge 
emanates stories of the bygone eras.
Impressions: Benoy Sebastian | Images: Prachi Damle
A BRIEF
Lakshman Sagar was originally a 
royal 19th century hunting lodge, owned by the then Thakur of Raipur. A fascinating destination, where the Mardana (men‚Äôs) tower has been converted into a breezy white and blue dining space, with a kitchen below it. Where a 
swimming pool has been cut 
into the rock plateau behind the Zanana (women‚Äôs) tower. Day beds, sheltered by thatching of dry vegetation, line one side of the lake. And, where 12 mud and stone cottages are spread out over the 32 acres of pristine landscape.  ACCOMMODATION
Th e 12 cottages are no less stunning 
than the rest of the property. Th  ey‚Äôre 
spacious (around 900 square feet each), and have independent bedrooms, living rooms with fi  replaces, private 
plunge pools overlooking the lake, and stone bathrooms with rain showers.

FOOD AND DINING
The food at Lakshman Sagar is a delightful surprise. It‚Äôs pure North India treat - and lots of it. Meals are pre-set. Breakfast is simple, but perfect: potato-stuffed parathas (flat bread) with homemade yoghurt and spicy pickles; eggs cooked to order; fruit salad and fresh-pressed sweet lime juice. Make sure you join in the field breakfast, set in front of a local farmer‚Äôs hut and watch the women make wheat bhakri  over 
an earthen oven. Meals are served inside the open-air Mardana, overlooking the lake or sometimes in the pretty little Zanana dining rooms (on special requests), or privately if you prefer.

Located in Panipat, Haryana and 
spread across an area of 3,650 sq 
ft, the Plus House owned by Payal and Vinod Juneja is a good mix of the modern as well as the traditional aspect of design. 
Architects Ankita Sweety and 
Pratyoosh Chandan perceived the house as a creation of rectangles within a square, which clearly took them to benefiting proportions during the planning. This was the answer to a rather questionable site which sat on an almost square plot of 55‚Äô x 58‚Äô , thus generating a challenge as well as curiosity to achieve depth and sight, ‚Äù says Pratyoosh.
The facade of the house has a complete 
25‚Äô high structure which can be seen as volumes and voids sharing spaces, overlapping and inter changing their behavior as well as presence. The vertical edge of the corner is sliced open in a tapered hugging manner with MS pergola on the roof level adding the play of shadows and light. The architects have used MS Jali at eminent places  for a complete traditional Indian effect. The use of textured orange paint balances its harmony through the cladding of Dholpur stone on to the left tower. The house caters to a family of four that revolves around and about a dense green focal point. ‚ÄúThe impact of this created courtyard can be felt from the entrance as well as the private areas of the house, ‚Äù says Pratyoosh. Sweety adds that ‚Äúthe ‚ÄòPlus‚Äô is

actually the two axes which has generated 
four rectangles within a square that goes from one end to the other. ‚Äù The design leads to a comfortable flow of air and light throughout the house.
The courtyard features a sunken pebble 
bed which comes with a glass top and acts as a centrestage for the house. Italian stone ‚ÄòDiana‚Äô has been used majorly for flooring. ‚ÄúWe have also used wooden flooring at few places to add warmth. Also, the addition of many sit out zones within the house was planned and  placed to add stories, ‚Äù shares Sweety. The use of Jali as a partitions have been matched with the furniture‚Äôs design. The ceiling of the lobby leads to the court  and is finished with veneer backed  by commercial board. The architects  have addwed colours in different areas of the house to add life. The puja room  is done in black onyx, the kitchen  features a beautiful sea green lacquered glass while a wallpaper adorns the  dining wall.The Ideal Home and Garden December 201 4  |  105  Nouveau Arrival
‚ÄúTraditional inserts can be seen in 
the rear door leading to the backyard which overlooks the coffee corner through the double height ceiling, ‚Äù explains Pratyoosh.  The backyard hosts a small shower pool adjoining the garden. A small bar sits as a vertical extension to the drawing room at the mezzanine level with a small pantry, a washroom and a private balcony. The entire area is backlit by onyx stone, white PU pigment paint and dark veneer. The dark green upholstery fabric of furniture brings youthfulness. ‚ÄúThe master bedroom and the children‚Äôs 106   |  December 2014  The Ideal Home and Garden

bedroom are designed to evolve as 
two characters with former being warm and the latter being young, ‚Äù shares the architects. 
Th e master bedroom has a play of 
browns and off  -whites  with the use of Victorian wallpaper and 
neo-victorian wall lights as well as a chandelier. Th  e study area in the 
kid‚Äôs room has a glossy pigment paint which is enhanced with pastel green laminate adding to the blue and white pin board. Th  e same colour The Ideal Home and Garden December 201 4  |  107  Nouveau Arrival
pattern is repeated on the rugs and 
curtains. Many hanging lights and custom-made ceiling lights have been used throughout the house to provide glamour and warmth. Altogether, it‚Äôs a house with spaces of varying identities yet similar character. Subscribe
