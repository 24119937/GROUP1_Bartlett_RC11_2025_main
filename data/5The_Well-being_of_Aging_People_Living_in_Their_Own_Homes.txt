Abstract
The present research adopts a transactional world view in which the home is conceived as a holistic entity comprising inter-related
qualities of people, activities, setting, and time. The study is guided by the congruence model of aging people/environment
interactions as ﬁrst suggested by (Kahana (1975). Aging the environment theoretical approaches. New York: Sage Publications) and
extended by (Carp (1987). Housing the aged, design directives and policy considerations. New-York: Elsevier). It aims at assessing the
general well-being of elderly women living in their own houses or ﬂats, while more speciﬁcally focussing on the well-being or
enjoyment they feel in everyday life situations. One hundred fourteen women residents of the Re´ gion Centre, France, ranging in age
from 72 to 86 years old, answered (a) a purposely developed questionnaire to measure their well-being in various everyday life
situations in their homes, (b) the ESV examining the general well-being of aging people (Blais, Vallerand, Pelletier, & Brie` re (1989).
Canadian Journal of Behavioral Science, 21, 210), a French adaptation of the Satisfaction With Life Scale, SWLS, designed by
Diener, Emmons, Larsen, and Grifﬁn ((1985). Journal of Personality Assessment, 49, 71), and (c) four items assessing (1) perceived
social pressure to leave their homes, (2) perceived housing-related constraints, (3) satisfaction with the neighborhood and (4)
satisfaction with the social environment. The results indicated differential impact of such factors as ‘‘age’’, ‘‘reasons for choosing to
stay in the home’’, ‘‘general well being’’, ‘‘degree of perceived social pressure’’, and ‘‘level of housing related constraints’’ on the well-
being felt by aging women living in their own homes, according to whether or not an activity is performed in company (alone or in
the presence either their spouses or guests).

1. Introduction
Most elderly people wish to live at home for as long as
they can (Oswald, Wahl, Mollenkolf, & Schilling, 2000).
In fact, many continue to live in residences they
occupied for most of their adult lives (Law & Warnes,
1982). Often, houses and ﬂats are full of priceless
souvenirs and precious memories (Pynoos & Regnier,
1991) that turn settings into meaningful places (Vikko,
1996). Homes are safe havens where people put down
roots,
feel
a
sense
of
belonging,
and
ultimately
experience ‘‘place identity’’, or oneness with the home
(Proshansky,
1978).
Dwellings
can
be
sources
of
physical and psychological revitalisation, which con-
tribute to emotional attachment and the sense that the
residence is a ‘‘home’’ (Casey, 1993; Hollander, 1993).
The stronger this sense of belonging, the safer, the freer
and the more comfortable aging people feel in their
homes (Fischer, 1997). The present research examines
how experiences in the home and feelings about the
home are related to quality of life among an aging
female population. The study is based on a transactional
world view, in which the home is conceived as a holistic
entity
comprising
inter-related
qualities
of
people,
activities, setting, and time (Altman & Rogoff, 1987).
The speciﬁc research approach is guided by Kahana’s
(1975) congruence model and Carp’s (1987) extension of
that model.
1.1. Determinants of general well-being of elderly people
In-depth studies related to the well-being of elderly
people have already been carried out with two types of
variables, (a) those that reﬂect socioeconomic factors,
and (b) those that refer to psychological and psycho-
social variables.

(a) The ﬁrst category indicates that well-being increases
with such variables as: increases in the general level
of wealth of the country of residence (Diener &
Diener, 1995), higher income (Mack, Salmoni,
Vivarais-Dressler, Porter, & Garg, 1997) and socio-
economic levels (Pinquart & So¨ rensen, 2000), as well
as when the respondent is married (Essex & Nam,
1987), and female (Rousseau & Dube´ , 1993).
(b) Research bearing on the second category has shown
that self-reported well-being is more positive when
self-reported health status is more positive (Webster,
1997), respondents report regular physical exercise
(McAuley et al., 2000), personality traits include
high
extraversion
and
high
emotional
stability
(Adkins, Martin, & Poon, 1996), respondents report
aspirations of self-development and interest in the
well-being of others (Lapierre, Bouffard, & Bastin,
1997), have more mature social understanding and
wisdom (Ardelt, 1997), have religious belief or faith
(Levin & Chatters, 1998), feel control over their
environment (Smits, Deeg, & Bosscher, 1995), feel
independent
(Mack
et
al.,
1997),
have
higher
numbers and quality of social relationships (Pin-
quart & So¨ rensen, 2000), and report a sense of
belonging to a supportive social network (Gibson,
1986).
Recent studies have shown that the level of general
well-being does not decrease with age (Pinquart, 1998)
but may even increase (Lawton, 1996). Though they are
often faced with problems of health and autonomy that
reduce their mobility and their involvement with their
social network, aging people have a feeling of general
well-being at least equal to that of other adults. Lawton
suggested this seemingly inconsistent result could be due
to the fact that the elderly have better control of their
feelings and are adaptable to change and unexpected
events in their everyday lives. One purpose of the
present study was to examine these ideas with respect to
control in and satisfaction with the home. Because
elderly people tend to spend more time at home, it is
important to study the determinants of well-being in this
important setting.
1.2. Housing-related determinants of well-being in elderly
people
Although homes are important for the elderly, little
research has examined relationships between life in the
home and well-being. Because they have less involve-
ment in outside activities, aging people may focus on or
emphasize their residences and their feelings of well-
being in their own homes as signiﬁcant components of
their general well-being.
Despite living in homes that are modest or even
inadequate for their unique needs, most elders perceive
their homes as restful, comfortable and safe spaces. This
might occur because elders’ homes often become the sole
and unique places where they maintain social bonds
with individuals and their community, and/or because
women do not want to go to an elder care home (Rioux,
2004). Some authors say that homes, as much as
spouses, are the most important element in the lives of
the elderly (Maltais, 1999a). At the centre of their lives,
the home can be an important source of well-being or,
alternatively, an obstacle to quality of life—an element
that facilitates or conversely undermines autonomy and
social integration (Kendig et al., 1996), and a place that
helps them to have control of everyday life or conversely
prevents them from having it (Morin, Dansereau, &
Nadeau, 1990). Therefore well-being is strongly related
to satisfaction with the home, neighbourhood, and level
of residential embeddedness or connection (Rousseau &
Dube´ , 1993). These relationships are found whatever the
type of housing, whether individual houses (Klein, 1993)
or large blocks (Carp & Christensen, 1986). Elders’
feelings of well-being in the home depend on such
factors as state of health, degree of physical disability
and sensory impairment (Klein, 1993), as well as on
psychological
variables
such
as self-esteem
(Klein,
1993).
Whereas this literature has examined housing-related
determinants of the well-being of elderly people, to the
best of my knowledge, little research has focused on the
feeling of well-being elderly people have in ‘‘micro-
situations’’, i.e. when performing routine daily activities
in their homes. Such an analysis is suggested by Altman
and colleagues’ transactional world view, in which the
home is conceived as a holistic entity comprising inter-
related qualities of people, activities, setting, and time
(Werner, Altman, & Oxley, 1985; Altman & Rogoff,
1987). This world view is reﬂected in Kahana’s (1975)
congruence model of aging people/environment transac-
tions, and Carp’s (1987) research on the ‘‘congruence-
complementarity’’ model, or factors relating to the well-
being of the elderly in a given environment. According
to congruence models, the well-being felt by the elderly
people results from the dynamic interaction between
their needs and/or their preferences on the one hand and
the environmental features on the other hand.
The present research adopts this perspective and
considers that the feeling of well-being in the home is a
complex construct that should be studied by combining
people, place and action, and to show that different
combinations have different meanings for the women.
For example, Rioux (2003) studied elderly women in
retirement homes and assessed how their well-being
differed as they performed routine activities in various
situations. Rioux found differential impact of such
factors as ‘‘age’’, ‘‘general well-being’’, and ‘‘length of
residence in the home’’ on women’s general well-being in
different spaces (individual lodging, common room),

and depending on whether the activity was social or not
(performed in company or alone). The present research
examines how these feelings about home contribute to
quality of life among an aging female population. I
propose that our understanding of well-being in the
home is enhanced by understanding the contributions of
psycho-social and environmental variables.
This work has two purposes:
(a) to assess the well-being of aging women living in
their own homes by asking how much they enjoy life
there, taking into account the types of activities, the
settings, and the social context (alone or with other
people) in which activities are performed; and
(b) to deﬁne the variables that will likely have some
inﬂuence on enjoyment in the home. Three types of
variables were studied: (1) bio-social variables such
as age and length of residence in the home; (2)
‘‘residential variables’’, or aspects of the physical
environment (such as the interior de´ cor, remodelling
of the interior and exterior, and the home’s distance
from the local shops, services and parks), and with
such social aspects as the frequency of social
relations, assistance at home (meals on wheels,
medical care), and frequency of outings; and lastly,
(3) psycho-social variables including: general well-
being; perceived social pressure to leave their homes;
housing-related constraints; satisfaction with the
neighbourhood and satisfaction with the social
environment; and the reasons elderly women give
for staying in their homes.
In her research on the well-being of elderly women
living in community homes, Rioux (2003) found that
older, longer-term residents were most satisﬁed by visits
from others. I hypothesize that these two variables—age
and length of residence—will have an impact in the
present sample as well. In addition, consistent with
research showing positive links between perceived well-
being in the home and the quality of the residential
environment (Carp & Christensen, 1986), residential
satisfaction (Rousseau & Dube´ , 1993) and general well-
being (Nagar & Paulus, 1997), I postulate that enjoying
everyday activities in the home will correlate positively
with residential variables, subjective general well-being
and satisfaction with the home in terms of the physical
and social environments. Furthermore, consistent with
Maltais’ (1999b) research showing that control over
decision making is associated with psychological well-
being, I suggest that enjoying life in the home will
correlate negatively with two factors: perceived social
pressure to leave the home, and reports of housing-
related constraints. Finally and related to the Paulus,
Nagar, and Camacho (1991) study about the impact of
choosing one’s home on well-being, I postulate that the
level of well-being in the home will be higher if women
use control-oriented justiﬁcations for staying in their
homes.
2. Method
2.1. Participants
One hundred fourteen women residents of the Re´ gion
Centre, France,1 ranging in age from 72 to 86 years old
and living at home with their spouses, constituted our
study sample. Participants were contacted through local
agencies that provide services to facilitate aging in place
(deliver meals, help with light housework), or groups
that organize activities for elders. They agreed to
identify elderly persons who met the sampling criteria
(no serious physical, cognitive, or psychological pro-
blems, although minor problems were acceptable), and
to contact them to propose an appointment. Individuals
were free to refuse to participate.
A female population was purposely chosen to under-
stand women’s points of view, and also because women
carry out most everyday activities within the home, such
as cooking, sewing or cleaning (Lemel, 1993; Lewin,
2001). Home-based experiences should be particularly
important among women of this age group because
most of them have been housewives all their lives and
their personal investment in their homes has probably
been strong.
The houses or ﬂats of the sample were at least 3-room
accommodations, to assure a variety of settings and uses
of the rooms. The rooms served a variety of purposes,
such as sitting-room, dining-room, kitchen, one or more
bedrooms, or a bedroom converted into a study or
storage area. The women and their spouses all had
enough physical autonomy to move around the different
rooms of their homes.
2.2. Materials
The data were collected with two complementary
tools:
 a purpose-built questionnaire. This 27-item ques-
tionnaire was developed in two steps, beginning with
semi-structured
interviews
of
10
elderly
women
residents of the Re´ gion Centre (France), who ranged
in age from 65 to 80 years old. Five of them were
living in ﬂats and ﬁve were in individual houses; ﬁve
were lodgers and ﬁve were owners. Each of them was
personally interviewed in her home by the author.
They were asked: ‘‘Could you tell me about your
everyday life in your home?’’ A thematic categories

analysis of their responses identiﬁed typical situations
that were experienced by elderly women in their
homes with regard to the different places, activities
and people involved. A 31-item questionnaire was
developed from this information, with the stipulation
that the people/setting/activity combinations needed
to be realistic. For example, it included typical
activities done with spouses, but did not include
those activities if they were not typically done with
guests. Items were arranged so as to separate
questions with similar activities, settings or people.
In step 2, the 31-item version was tested on 12 elderly
women who had been sampled using the same criteria as
the ﬁrst group. Their responses were analysed, and four
items were eliminated from the questionnaire. The ﬁnal
questionnaire, composed of 27 items, can be found in
the appendix. Each item began ‘‘I enjoy’’,2 and response
options ranged from (1) ‘‘Total disagreement’’ to (5)
‘‘Total agreement’’ on a Likert-type scale.
 the ESV for aging people (Blais, Vallerand, Pelletier,
& Brie` re, 1989), is a French adaptation of the
Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), designed by
Diener, Emmons, Larsen, and Grifﬁn (1985). This
tool can be used with different age groups but has
proved particularly useful with elderly people as it
takes very little time to answer. This ﬁve-item, one-
dimension scale measures a variety of aspects related
to quality of life (‘‘In most ways my life is close to my
ideal’’; ‘‘The conditions of my life are excellent’’; ‘‘I
am satisﬁed with my life’’; ‘‘So far I have gotten the
important things in want in life’’; ‘‘If I could live my
life over I could change almost nothing’’). It offers
good psychometric characteristics very similar to the
original SWLS. In terms of reliability, the ESV
internal coherence is excellent (Cronbach’s a ¼ .80),
and its test–retest reliability is satisfactory (reliability
coefﬁcient ¼ .64). Response options ranged from (1)
‘‘Total disagreement’’ to (7) ‘‘Total agreement’’ on a
Likert-type scale.
Lastly, an open-ended question and four simple
housing and neighbourhood items were developed.
The open-ended question asked the women to deﬁne
their reasons for choosing to stay in their present homes
(‘‘What are your reasons for living in this house or ﬂat?’’).
The four simple housing and neighbourhood items
assessed: perceptions that others wanted them to leave
their homes (‘‘I am often told it would be better if I left
this house or ﬂat’’); housing-related constraints (‘‘I often
ﬁnd it difﬁcult and constraining to live in this house or
ﬂat’’); satisfaction with the neighbourhood (‘‘My home
is located in a pleasant neighbourhood’’) and satisfaction
with the social environment (‘I am satisﬁed with the
relations I have with my neighbours’). Respondents
answered using 5-point Likert-type scales, with response
options ranging from (1) ‘‘Total disagreement’’ to (5)
‘‘Total agreement’’, and high scores indicating, respec-
tively, high perceived pressure to move, high constraints
in the home, satisfaction with the neighbourhood, and
satisfaction with social relations.
2.3. Procedure
Each participant received a visit from the author at
home, at a prearranged time. After a brief introduction
to the project, the author read the following instruc-
tions: ‘‘I am going to ask you questions about your
everyday life in your house or ﬂat and I will ask you to
respond by choosing one of the possible answers.’’ Each
item
was
presented
orally.
In
front
of
her,
the
participant had a sheet of paper presenting the response
scales, and her choice was then recorded by the
interviewer. The same procedure was then applied to
the ESV general well-being scale. Next, the interviewer
asked the open-ended question and the four simple
housing and neighbourhood items. Then, to conclude
the interview, she collected the data concerning (a) the
house or ﬂat (interior and exterior design, and any
remodelling), and (b) the respondent’s bio-social quali-
ties (age, length of residence in the home) as well as
social factors (social relationships, number of outings,
and so on).
3. Results
3.1. Description of the sample
The sample comprised 114 women living with their
spouse or companion in their own homes. Eighty-nine
percent were married and 11% were cohabiting. Forty-
eight percent owned their lodgings, 52% rented them.
Forty-six percent lived in ﬂats and 54% lived in
individual houses. Nineteen percent of these women
had been living in their lodgings for less than 20 years,
37% for between 20 and 40 years, and 44% had lived
there for over 40 years; the average length of residence
was 37 years. Fully 75% of the women reported
receiving some assistance to enable them to stay in their
homes (Table 1). All but one woman reported typical
problems of aging that might affect every day function-
ing. Seventy-two percent reported mobility problems;
82% had difﬁculty sleeping; 94% said they moved more
slowly, and routine activities took longer than pre-
viously; and 96% reported memory problems.

With respect to assessing physical environmental
variables, only 21% reported they had had their homes
modiﬁed to accommodate their advancing age (Table 1).
Those who had converted their homes had altered both
the inside and outside, rðdf ¼ 112Þ ¼ :38, po:05. These
conversions were made to face general difﬁculties of
aging and occasionally to cope with a particular
disability (auditory, visual, cognitive or other impair-
ment).
This was a low rate of remodelling, compared to
preventive actions recommended by local and national
French authorities, and occurred in spite of the fact that
conversions could have improved their lives and reduced
their risks of accident (e.g. moving dishes to a lower
cupboard; installing a ramp so they could safely leave
their homes). Although our sample was composed of
people who had not presented any signs of psychological
or psychiatric disorder or any serious physical disabil-
ities, conversions are recommended before they are
needed in order to prevent problems. The researcher
identiﬁed an additional 32 women who would have
beneﬁted from some kind of home conversion.
Approximately 80% of the women lived less than
2 km away from essential services (shops, town-council
services, doctors), and nearly 90% lived 2 km or less
from a park, a garden, a forest or some other green area.
There was no signiﬁcant correlation between length of
residence in the home and distance from services,
rð1 1 2Þ ¼ :06, and green areas, rð1 1 2Þ ¼ :09. Most of
the women (81%) had lived there for over 20 years,
suggesting, as they do, that these elderly women were
not preoccupied by any physical problems of aging
when they chose their neighbourhood environment, yet
the convenience of their neighbourhood seems to have
come to constitute a fundamental reason for them to
stay in their homes.
Table 2 presents the distributions for residential items
(information about the physical environment), fre-
quency of social relations (with neighbours, friends,
relatives), frequency of assistance at home (meals, house
cleaning, shopping), and the number of outings (neces-
sary outings, leisure outings). The results show that, on
the whole, social relations were frequent and varied, and
relations with neighbours were more common than
those with family/relatives. Not shown in the table is an
important ﬁnding: 8% of these elderly women indulged
in no interaction outside the relations they maintain
with their spouses or partners.
3.2. Well-being of elderly women in their homes
Table 3 presents the means, standard deviations and
number of people who responded for each item on the
‘‘well-being in the home’’ questionnaire. The means vary
from a high of 4.79 for ‘‘I enjoy watching television with
my spouse, in the sitting-room’’ to a low of 1.63 for ‘‘I
enjoy having a meal alone in my kitchen.’’ Standard
deviations range from 1.59 for ‘‘I enjoy reading alone in
my sitting-room’’ to 0.30 for ‘‘I enjoy doing some odd jobs
with my spouse in the sitting room.’’
On the whole, results showed that our sample of
women particularly enjoyed performing an activity in
the company of guests. The means of the items referring
to such activities range from 4.17 ‘‘I enjoy doing the
cooking and guests are present’’ to 4.70 ‘‘I enjoy watching
television with guests in the sitting-room’’. Equally high
were the means of the items referring to an activity
performed in the presence of the spouse, whatever the
type of activity (cooking, doing odd jobs, talking,
having lunch, playing games). The means of the latter
items ranged from 3.70 for ‘‘I enjoy talking with my
spouse in my bedroom’’ to 4.79 for ‘‘I enjoy watching
television with my spouse, in the sitting-room’’. The item
‘‘I enjoy having a meal with my spouse in the kitchen’’ had
the lowest mean (3.40), which is still above the mid-
point on the scale.
Lower means were associated with activities per-
formed alone in the house or ﬂat. The lowest means
were 1.63 for ‘‘I enjoy having a meal alone in my kitchen’’
and 2.72 for ‘‘I enjoy doing housework alone in my
bedroom’’. One exception was the very positive score of
4.38 for ‘‘reading alone in my bedroom’’.
An exploratory factor analysis was then conducted on
these 27 items, using a principal components extraction
followed by Varimax rotation on factors with an

eigenvalue greater than 1. This yielded 4 factors. As
shown in Table 3, ten items loaded on the ﬁrst factor
and explained 13% of total variance. This factor
referred to well-being when performing everyday activ-
ities With Other People (the spouse or guests) and will
be called (WOP). The second factor contained 6 items
and
referred
to
well-being
when
an
activity
was
performed in the Presence of the Spouse only (PS); it
explained 13% of the variance. The third factor
contained 6 items about well-being when performing
an activity Alone (A), and explained 11% of the
variance. The fourth and ﬁnal factor contained 5 items
and corresponded to well-being when Guests were
Present in the lodgings (PG); it explained 10% of the
variance. Together these four factors explained 47% of
total variance. Thus, for the most part, the factors
reﬂected the women’s different social environments
(alone, with spouse, with guests, or with spouse and
guests) rather than particular activities or settings.
Mean factor scores were computed by taking the
mean across the items in each factor. An ANOVA
performed on these scores for ‘‘activities with guests’’ vs.
‘‘activities
with
the
spouse’’
vs.
‘‘activities
alone’’
revealed a signiﬁcant effect of the social context,

Scheffe
comparisons showed that the women felt better when
they performed an activity with or in the presence of
guests (mean score ¼ 3.90) than they did with or in
presence of their spouse (mean score ¼ 3.60) or alone
(mean score ¼ 3.39).
3.3. General well-being of aging women (ESV)
We adapted the SWLS questionnaire to our sample,
so a conﬁrmatory factor analysis was used to verify that
our data replicated the uni-dimensional model obtained
by Diener et al. (1985). The analysis showed that the
overall Goodness of Fit Index was reasonably high. The
value of the GFI was 0.92 and that of the adjusted GFI
(AGFI) was 0.86. The w2ð10Þ ¼ 257:13; all path coefﬁ-
cients were signiﬁcant (po:05).
Overall, the general well-being scores were fairly high
for this sample of elderly women. The mean obtained on
the
7-point
scale
was
4.71
with
low
variability
(s.d. ¼ :17). By comparison, in samples of elderly men
and women, Pavot, Diener, and Suh (1998) obtained a
mean of 5.18 and Rioux (2003) obtained a mean of 4.51
on this scale. Consistent with the idea that relationships
are very important to well being among the elderly,
socializing with neighbours (rðdf ¼ 112Þ ¼ :33), with
friends (rðdf ¼ 112Þ ¼ :31, po:05) and with family
(rðdf ¼ 112Þ ¼ :20, po:05) correlated signiﬁcantly with
general well-being. These correlations did not differ
signiﬁcantly.
3.4. Level of perceived housing-related constraint
Perceived housing-related constraint was close to the
midpoint on the 5-point scale, where 5 was the highest
level of constraint (M ¼ 2:3; s.d. ¼ :68). There was a
clear split between aging women who feel no constraints

in their homes (46%, or 52 women) and those who
complained about the way their homes were ﬁtted out
(42%, or 48 women). Many women had no complaints
because their homes had been converted inside and/or
outside (25%). A woman who had remodelled said ‘‘It’s
been easier to move about the house since we had the
place converted. We are glad we listened to the town
council advisers.’’
Of those reporting no constraints in their homes,
some had problems but simply wanted to ignore them
(11, or 21% of these aging women). For example, one
elderly woman had no handrails on stairs inside or
outside her home and needed a cane to walk up and
down the stairs. She reported ‘‘We have no problem at
all with the way it is ﬁtted out, it is convenient enough as
it is. There is nothing to complain about.’’ The
remaining informants did complain about their homes.
As one respondent said ‘‘It is not convenient at all. It is
hard to climb those stairs, you know, andythere are no
toilets on the ground-ﬂoor so we have to climb’’ (the
landlord had actually suggested having some remodeling
done). Thus, more than half of the sample actually had
mobility problems that affected their quality of life.
3.5. Reasons for choosing to stay in the home
Each of the women interviewed was asked the
following open-ended question: ‘‘Why are you currently
living in this house or ﬂat?’’ A content analysis allowed us
to divide the 114 answers into two sets, referring to (a)
the feeling of being rooted in an environment through
memories and objects (N ¼ 96), and (b) their concerns
about the future (N ¼ 48).
The ﬁrst group of women told essentially of their
attachment to their souvenirs and memories (86% of the
96; e.g. ‘‘My children were born hereyall our memories

lie here, in this housey all my life has been here3),
attachment to their house or ﬂat (73%; e.g. ‘‘We ﬁtted
up the house little by little to suit our taste, make it
homeythis home must be the same as now, until I am
no longer here—when I die’’), attachment to their
neighbourhood (56%; e.g. ‘‘This part of the town has
greatly changed, still yit’s our neighbourhood’’), their
neighbours (37%; e.g. ‘‘We have known the neighbours
for 30 years, it is like we were bound, we trust each
otheryour life is here,’’), and/or attachment to their
town or village (24%; e.g. ‘‘We know our whereabouts
here. The town-hall square is a bit like our home’’).
Although all the women reported some physical
difﬁculties, they said that staying in their houses or ﬂats
was the best way for them to feel ‘‘at home’’. These
women endured some negative everyday events and
took comfort in their memory-ﬁlled homes, perceived as
havens.
The second group of women most often told about
their fear of change (62% of the 48; ‘‘The thing is, you
don’t know what it’ll be like; sure we do feel much better
at home.’’), of being unable to have control over the
course of their lives (61%; e.g. ‘‘If we have to go, then
we’ll go but it’ll never be the same. When you’re old,
you can’t change just like that.’’), of losing their freedom
of action (58%; e.g. ‘‘There’ll be rules; I’ll have to
comply like the rest of them, and I won’t like it.’’), their
preferences (42%; e.g. ‘‘We have dinner at 7 p.m. then
we will have a game and then we go to bedyIt will all
be different for sure’’), their habits (34%; e.g. ‘‘We have
our ways, it’ll be all a shambles if we have to leave.’’),
and mostly of being separated from their spouses (82%;
e.g. ‘‘What frightens me most is they can decide to part
us, I do fear that’’). They said that staying in their
homes was the best way for them to remain autono-
mous, to have control of everyday events and to make
plans to do what they like.
3.6. Level of perceived social pressure
Perceived social pressure was measured on a 5-point
Likert-type scale, with a 5 indicating high perceived
pressure. The mean of 1.75 (s.d. ¼ 1:32) was below the
midpoint of the scale, suggesting overall, the women felt
low
pressure
to
move.
However,
examination
of
individual comments indicated that some women felt
pressure to move, but their reaction to the pressure
depended on the source. Third parties tended to have
more inﬂuence if they were disinterested (17% of these
elderly women; e.g. ‘‘Our househelp keeps telling us we
ought to agree to moveywe end up thinking she may be
right.’’), or if the elderly woman felt she was a burden
(24%; e.g. ‘‘The neighbours are nice but we depend on
them to do the shopping or go to the doctor’s, this can’t
last for everyWell, it is not that they say anything but
we know we are bothering them.’’). On the other hand
whenever the third party was seen as likely to derive
some advantage from the woman’s leaving, the per-
ceived social pressure was often discounted or ignored
(44%; e.g. ‘‘The nurse says that, at our age, we’d be
better off in an old-people home. Of course then she
wouldn’t have to come up to here. We may be in the
middle of nowhere but that’s where we live, it’s our
home’’). This feeling was heightened when the person
perceived to be exerting pressure was related to the
woman (e.g. ‘‘They don’t say anything but we know very
well they take holidays at a separate time. That makes us
consider leaving.’’ ‘‘I am aware that my daughter-in-law
wants the kitchen garden all to herself. She tells us we
ought to move but we won’t listen to her.’’). Despite
these comments, no speciﬁc example of real pressure in
acts or words was given by any of these elderly women.
Apparently, the level of perceived social pressure had
little to do with the level of pressure that could be
objectively described.
3.7. Level of satisfaction with the home’s location
Satisfaction with the home’s location was slightly
above the midpoint (with a 5 indicating high satisfac-
tion), whether satisfaction referred to the physical
environment
in
the
neighbourhood
(M ¼ 3:78;
s.d. ¼ :87) or to the social environment of neighbours
(M ¼ 3:54; s.d. ¼ 1:02). The two satisfaction scores
were
modestly
but
signiﬁcantly
correlated
(rðdf ¼ 112Þ ¼ :27, po:05), suggesting that our sample
was split into two groups: (a) women with a high degree
of residential satisfaction in terms of physical and social
environment and (b) women with a low degree of
satisfaction in the same domains.
3.8. Predictors of well-being in the home
The
purpose
of
our
research
was
to
examine
predictors of positive experiences in the home. Table 4
shows correlations between the bio-social variables, the
four simple housing and neighbourhood items, the
residential variables and level of general well-being on
the one side, with the four factor scores on the other, i.e.
enjoyment when an activity was performed With Other
People
(WOP),
enjoyment
when
an
activity
was
performed in the Presence of the Spouse (PS), enjoyment
when
an activity was performed Alone (A), and
enjoyment when an activity was performed in the
Presence of Guests (PG).

3These quotations are difﬁcult to translate accurately from the
original French. We translated ‘‘ma vie est ici’’ as ‘‘my life is here’’ but
the connotation is that ‘‘my life is now ﬁnished, I don’t expect anything
more in my life.’’ Although the women never use this term, they mean
‘‘I wait here to die.’’

As shown in Table 4, many variables were not related
to any of the factor scores. Whether the home had been
modiﬁed, proximity to services and parks, frequency of
interactions with neighbours, friends, and relatives,
frequency of leisure and necessary outings, and satisfac-
tion with the neighbourhood and neighbours were all
unrelated to how women felt when engaged in activities
inside their homes.
On the other hand, several variables were signiﬁcantly
related to the enjoyment scores. To identify which
variables were unique predictors of enjoyment while doing
activities at home, three separate regression analyses were
conducted, one for each of the well-being factor scores
(Presence of the Spouse, PS; Alone, A; and Presence of
Guests, PG). In each regression, the set of predictors was
limited to the bio-social and psychosocial variables that
had correlated signiﬁcantly with the factor scores. Note
that no bio-social variables proved to be a predictor of
either the PG or A factor. Results are presented in Table 5.
Presence of spouse. Two variables predicted the well-
being of elderly women when they were performing
activities in the presence of their spouses (PS), and
accounted for 64% of the variance, i.e. the perception of
high housing-related constraints (R ¼ 0:73), and posi-
tive general well-being (R ¼ 0:32).
Alone. The level of perceived pressure to leave her
home (R ¼ 0:57) and the level of general well-being
(R ¼ 0:17) were predictors of the person’s well-being
when she was alone (A) in her home, and accounted for
36% of the variance.
Guests. Two predictors, accounting for 27% of the
variance, were signiﬁcant with regard to the well-being
of the elderly woman when she welcomed guests at
home (PG), i.e. reasons for choosing to stay in her home
(0 ¼ emphasis on the past; 1 ¼ emphasis on controlling
the future) (R ¼ 0:45) and age (R ¼ 0:26). The older the
woman, and the more she felt she had control of her
everyday life, the better she felt when she welcomed
guests at home.
Spouse
and
guests.
No
regression
analysis
was
conducted with activities in the company of spouse
and guests (WOP) as a criterion, since only general well-
being yielded a signiﬁcant zero-order correlation with
this factor. This correlation was moderate (r ¼ 0:19),
suggesting that other variables, not measured in the
present study, would predict affect in these situations.
4. Discussion
The present research had a double aim: (a) to assess
the well-being of aging women in their homes and (b) to
determine likely predictors of this well-being.

First, with respect to general well being, the results
suggested that the well-being of this sample of aging
women is good. The results were consistent with
Pinquart’s
(1998)
research
and
Cameron’s
(1995)
extensive comparative study, both showing that the
level of general well-being does not decrease with age, as
aging induced deﬁciencies are not necessarily felt by
elderly women as impairments for their daily lives (Park
& Gutchess, 2000).
Descriptive information indicated that women re-
ported high rates of contact with others. Only 8%
reported no contacts outside their homes. In general, by
living in their own homes, the women maintained
control of the relationships they initiate. Seeking out
contact with others may be a strategy for optimizing
their level of well-being. This ‘‘active coping’’ strategy
(Seiffge-Krenke, 1995) found its expression in the
development of regular and rather frequent contacts
with their neighbours, relatives or/and friends.
Descriptive information also indicated that only 21%
of the women had remodelled their homes in order to
support declining physical abilities. The large majority
had not made needed changes, although many had been
encouraged to remodel by landlords or agency person-
nel. Failing to take such preventive actions could be due
to a lack of information, fear of the future, and/or a
belief that they were too old to cope with the disruption
of a conversion.
Consistent with the transactional world view and
congruence theories, it was presumed from the start that
the in-home well-being of this sample would depend on
a combination of the type of activity being performed,
its social context (whether performed alone or with
other people), and the place where it was performed.
Only one ﬁnding was consistent with this view. Reading
while alone received a very high score, but the other
solitary activities received low scores. This pattern
underscores the congruence model idea that affect is
related to combinations of activity, setting, and social
context: Being alone is not always negative.
Instead of unique combinations of activity, social
context,
and
physical
setting,
the
factor
analysis
indicated that items clustered together simply according
to the social context of the activities (A—alone, PS—
presence of the spouse or companion, WOP—with the
spouse or guests, and PG—presence of guests). When
the
questionnaire
items
were
simply
broken
into
activities done alone, with the spouse, and with guests,
an ANOVA indicated that activities performed with or
in the presence of another person were more enjoyable
than were activities performed alone. Both the factor
analysis and the ANOVA are consistent with the great
importance elderly people ascribe to social relationships
(Pinquart & So¨ rensen, 2000). A meta-analysis of 286
surveys (Pinquart & So¨ rensen, 2000) underscored the
strong relationship between quality of social relations
and general well-being, not just for elders, but for all age
groups.
The second major purpose was to identify predictors
of enjoyment in the home. The particular predictors of
well-being differed, depending on the social character of
the activity performed. For activities undertaken alone,
the more an elderly woman noticed social pressure to
leave her home, the better she felt when she was alone at
home and the higher degree of general well-being she
had. These women may have avoided conﬂicts and
found shelter in the solitude of their home since they had
chosen to stay there despite the pressure they said was
exerted on them.
When considering activities undertaken with or in the
presence of the spouse, the two signiﬁcant predictors
were perceived housing related constraints and general
well-being. The higher these were, the stronger the
feeling of well-being when an activity was performed in

the presence of the spouse. It may be that any housing
related hindrance made life at home all the more
precious which led to increased general well-being. That
is, it may be these material difﬁculties were experienced
positively because the elderly woman overcame them
every day, thus proving her ability to live in her home.
The ﬁnal activities were those done with friends, and
results indicated that the older the woman, and the more
future oriented her reasons for staying in her home, the
more she enjoyed having guests in her home. Welcoming
guests enabled elderly women to feel as if they were not
only taking part in the events of their daily lives but
controlling them; receiving guests is a free choice, a
decision that can be a source of well-being, particularly
for the oldest of them who appreciate that they were still
able to act as hostesses. These results are in keeping with
the studies carried out by Moos and Lemke (1994) and
Maltais (1999b) showing a strong relationship between
general well-being in elder care homes and perceived
control over one’s environment. The results are also
similar to those obtained by Rioux (2003) from a female
population living in elder care homes. In that study,
women expressing the highest degree of satisfaction
when guests were present in their private lodgings were
the
oldest
residents.
Rioux
suggested
that
social
comparison
played
an
important
role,
since
their
reference group was a group of people their age, hence
most likely to experience serious health troubles; there-
fore they would be particularly pleased to be able to
welcome guests in their lodgings.
No residential or ‘‘physical environmental’’ variable
predicted enjoyment in the home. This contrasts with
the results from surveys of aging women residing in
elder care homes, whose well-being varied according to
the quality of the services they received in terms of
safety, cleanliness, calm, and distance (Fernandez-
Ballesteros, 2001), and according to the social support
that existed in terms of adaptation to the abilities, needs,
and expectations of the residents (Maltais, 1999b;
Dzuka & Dalbert, 2000). It is possible that aging
women living in their own homes could attach less
importance to their physical environment because they
control their homes, but also because they focus on their
social environment, which they manage and control
themselves. Thus the feeling that one is losing control of
one’s environment, particularly noticeable in elder care
homes (Caouette, 1995), should be much weaker, even
non-existent in this sample. It must be said, though, that
perceived loss of control
greatly
depends on the
institutional structure in the facility. In elder care homes
that control day to day activities, elderly people tend to
be less autonomous, they participate less in collective or/
and personal decision making, and they report or
exhibit lower levels of well-being (Moos & Lemke,
1994). Conversely institutions that let their residents
have a say in decision making—including what rules
they comply with and the choice and organisation of
their activities—generate higher levels of well-being in
their residents (Feinhold & Werby, 1990). Maltais’
(1999b) study showed that elder’s perceived control
over decision making was more important than actual
decision making for generating a feeling of well-being—
however fragile the people may have been. This line of
work suggests that aging women living in their own
homes enjoy a comparatively high level of well-being
because they believe they make their decisions indepen-
dently, and thus perceive control of their lives.
Our general ﬁnding is that aging women who live in
their own homes feel good in their day to day activities
and report generally positive well being. This suggests
they are coping successfully with the multitude of age
related difﬁculties typical of their age group. These
troubles are known (a) to affect aging people much more
seriously than any traumas or major events that may
occur in their lives (Lazarus & De Longis, 1983), and (b)
to have the potential to undermine their level of general
well-being (Burk & Martins, 1985). Day to day positive
affect could be an important component of resilience in
aging—that is, the ability to age ‘‘successfully’’ despite
age related difﬁculties (Vaillant & Mukamal, 2001).
Thus, the well-being that is felt in their home may be an
important contributor to the successful aging of women.
Our research underscored the importance of three out of
the six factors proposed by Ryff in her integrative model
of successful aging (Ryff, 1989), namely preservation of
autonomy, good relationships with other people and
control of the environment. Furthermore, it highlighted
the
importance
of
housing-related
constraints
and
reminds us of the vital role played by the social
environment.
In the ﬁeld of the environmental psychology of aging,
this research can be continued in two directions. First, is
to further examine the ﬁnding of relatively high level of
well-being among this sample of elderly women living in
their own home. It may be that elders reported generally
positive well being because they were doing well or
because they have developed lower expectations about
their quality of life. Future research might evaluate
respondents’ Future Time Perspective (FTP), which
measures elders’ aspirations, goals or personal projects,
and this might provide more information about their
expectations.
Second, this research showed mixed support for the
hypothesis that elders’ everyday enjoyment at home
would be related to combinations of people/place/
activity. Except for ‘‘reading alone’’ which did represent
a unique combination, the factor analysis indicated that
enjoyment was highly inﬂuenced by the social context.
How they felt about activities depended on whom they
were with more than particular activities or where they
were performed in the home. To some extent, this could
be an artefact, because I deliberately excluded people/

place/activities combinations that did not make sense in
order to achieve ecological validity (e.g. I did not ask
how they felt about cooking in the sitting room). In
addition, the response scale had a restricted range (1–5);
perhaps a broader, more sensitive scale would have
detected differences among particular combinations.
Future research could address some of these issues.
Moreover, future research could examine how enjoy-
ment at home varies with participant sex (Rioux, 2004)
and type of housing—home (Rioux, 2004) versus
community
home
(Rioux,
2003).
The
importance
respondents appeared to place on being able to age in
place may have obscured more subtle differences in
enjoyment from one people/place/activity combination
to another. Many elders have to go to an elder care
home, so using a transactional framework to study what
combinations of people/place/activity increase elders’
well-being in those settings may be very important.
