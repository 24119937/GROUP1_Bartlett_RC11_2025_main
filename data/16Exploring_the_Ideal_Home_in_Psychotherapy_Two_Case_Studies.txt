Abstract
This paper illustrates the contribution of ‘ecoanalysis of the home’ to the psychotherapy of two patients.
Ecoanalytical tasks revealed how the patients’ relations to their ideal home}the meanings they attributed
to it as well as its spatial configuration}related to their difficulties. The depressed patient understood that
her attempt to reconstruct her childhood home in her new environment}a kibbutz in Israel}was part of a
fantasy to recreate her ‘lost paradise’. This constituted an obstacle in developing an attachment to the
kibbutz and was also the reason for some of her social problems within it. The other patient, who had been
traumatized by rape, regarded her ideal home as a representation of her body. Doing so helped her talk about
the rape and recognize its impact on her present sexual problems.

Introduction
The significance of the relation of a person to his or
her home has been neglected in the literature of
psychotherapy. However, the potential contribution
of this perspective may be inferred from references

claims that
the spatial organization of homes, throughout his-

body which are ordered in symbolic oppositions
such as cleanrdirty, dayrnight and publicrprivate.
The zones of the body are the model for the

symbolic partition of the home. Cunningham 1979
demonstrates symbolic preference for the right-
hand side over the left-hand side in the Atoni house

Indonesia . He found that male symbols and activi-
ties were localized on the right-hand side and out-
side, whereas female symbols and activities were
localized in the internal part and, especially, in the
Ž

left-hand part of it. He cites Hertz
1979 , who
argues that the preference for the right-hand side
is universal, and stems from the apparent physical
advantage of the right-hand over the left one.

preted a dream of a house as symbolizing his soul:
‘it was clear to me that the house represented an
image of the soul}i.e., of my state of consciousness
at that time, with some sub-conscious additions.
The consciousness was displayed by the living-room
which had the atmosphere of a lived-in place in
spite of its antique style. The basement stood for
the first level of the sub-conscious. The deeper I
went, the darker and the more alienating the scene
became. In the cave I discovered the remnants of an
ancient civilization}the world of primitive man
within myself.’ In fact, Jung built his own home at
Bollingen, and later re-built it, according to his
dreams of houses, and as a manifestation of his

of past homes are important for psychoanalysis
since they may be considered reliable documents
testifying to the shape which patients give to inti-
macy. Indeed, the ‘draw a house’ test is part of the
classical psychodiagnostic battery. It is interpreted
as a ‘self-portrait’, and as one’s self-image within

Bollas 1987 , in a case study which he calls ‘The

perament. It is sparse, the library is graced only

The emotional attachment to one’s home is dis-
Ž
.
cussed by Kernberg 1986 , who points out the emo-
tional investment of people in a room, a home, or
any other physical environment associated with the
experience of love relations. He argues that creat-
ing internal representations of an environment
where love relations took place is linked with a
feeling of permanence of these relations. He consid-
ers this as a normal defense mechanism, linked
with the libidinal investment in another person as
well as in one’s own self. This is dramatically illus-
trated, he further argues, in cases of patients with
pathological narcissism, for whom narcissistic loss
or failure may lead to frightening experiences of
alienation, as well as to the loss of meaning with
regard to the inanimate world. A case study of a
woman who had developed paranoid thought disor-
ders after her apartment was robbed is presented
Ž
.
by Minuchin 1974, p. 11 . Following this incident,
the woman moved to another apartment. The ther-
Ž
.
apist probably Minuchin himself interpreted her
situation as an ‘ecological crisis’ and explained to
her that in loosing her flat, she ‘had lost her shell’,
and was as vulnerable as ‘any crab that lost his
shell’. The therapist focused on speeding up the
patient’s adaptation rate to her new home, thus
contributing to the disappearance of the symptoms
and preventing her from being hospitalized.
While the literature on psychotherapy generally
ignores the person’s relations to his home, evidence
has been accumulating in the field of environmen-
tal psychology suggesting that home interiors, with
their symbolic and physical properties, provide an
understanding of the resident’s intimate relation-
ship with objects and space as well as with other

.
persons living in the house
Rullo, 1987 . Attach-
ment to one’s home is a general phenomenon, asso-
ciated with the relations to others at home, and
linked to one’s social and cultural context, as well
as to one’s residential history. Home attachment
develops subconsciously and
becomes conscious
when the person involved is separated from his

The influence of the spatial dimensions of child-
hood homes on the fantasy of the ‘ideal home’ is

demonstrated by Cooper 1974 who found among
students of architecture that the designs they made
of their ‘ideal home’ resembled their drawings of
their childhood homes. Later on, Cooper-Marcus
Ž
.
1995 found that the re-creation, in their present
home, of entities from past places was meaningful
to her interviewees. However, some of them who
wanted to create entities diametrically opposed to

linked
this
desire
with
unpleasant memories of their parents’ conduct.
Ž
.
Cooper-Marcus 1995 presents several techniques
Ž
.
such as environmental autobiography memories ,
interviews and graphic and imagery methods which
help people understand how their home is a reflec-
tion of their self.
The potential contribution of environmental psy-
chology to psychotherapy is demonstrated by Peled
Ž
.
and Ayalon 1988 who present the case study of a
couple in marital psychotherapy who were about to
build a house for themselves. They went through an
ecoanalytical process that helped reveal how the

differences between the meanings each of them
attached to his and her desired home were a mani-
festation of the conflicts between them. The data
obtained were integrated into the couple’s therapy
as well as in the layout of their new house.
The use of ‘Ecoanalysis of the Home’ in
psychotherapy
Ecoanalysis is a process intended at making the
interviewee aware of the existential meanings he or
she invests in the spatial presence of a place, or
type of place. A variety of projective techniques are
employed to enable the interviewee to get in touch
with his or her feelings towards the place as a
situation and a presence. In this paper we will
describe an attempt to integrate the ecoanalytical
method in the psychotherapy of two patients. The
Ž
.
first patient
whom we shall call Tally
was a
29-year-old single woman who suffered from a
depressive condition as a result of her problems in
adjusting to her new home}a kibbutz in Israel.
Her ambivalent feelings towards the kibbutz led
the therapist to suggest that she take the ecoana-
lytical tests before she decides definitely to leave
the place.
Ž
.
The second patient whom we shall call Lilly was
a 28-year-old single woman who asked for therapy
because of sexual problems. Apparently she devel-
oped a troubled pattern of sexual behavior: she
would seduce males to her apartment, and then
when they tried to have sexual intercourse with
her, she would react with physical aggression
towards them. Lilly was raped when she was 15-
years-old, but was not able to talk about this trauma
with anyone. In the beginning of the therapy she
mentioned the event but could not continue talking
about it. Actually, whenever the subject would be
raised by the therapist she would miss her next
psychotherapy session. The therapist, who was
already acquainted with the ecoanalytical tasks,
thought they might enable Lilly express metaphori-
cally her fears, and especially those associated with
her body.
Two ecoanalytical tasks were administered by
the therapist to each of the patients: the Location

enables subjects to create the
spatial configuration of his or her ideal home and
does not require any skill in design. The REP
FIGURE 1. Location task board
focuses on the examination of the way the inter-
viewee is construing various places, which are
either similar or in contrast to the interviewee’s
home. It is based on the Role Construct Test which

was developed by Kelly
1955 . Similar uses of

were
demonstrated
by

.
 
Ž
.
Stringer
1974 , Harisson and Sarre
1975
and
Ž
.
Honikman 1975 . It was shown that the REP was
effective in eliciting cognitive images of the physi-
cal environment, and that there was a connection
between the image the subjects had of the environ-
ment and their behavior within it.
Each of the patients performed the tasks individ-
ually. The performed tasks were analysed by the
authors of this paper and the results were inte-
grated into the therapy of each patient.
Administration of the tasks
In order to perform the Location Task, each of the
Ž
patients received a paper board of 50=50 cm Fig-
.
.
ure 1 and round stickers, 2 5 cm in diameter. The
patient was asked to imagine her ideal home and
make a list of places within the home, as well as
places outside}either places she would like to be
able to see from her home, or places she would like
to have in its immediate vicinity. Afterwards she
was asked to write down on the stickers the names
of the inside and outside desired places and attach
the stickers to the task board in the positions where
she would like them to be located. It took each
woman about 30 min to perform this task.

In order to perform the REP, Tally and Lilly
received eight paper cards. They were asked to
write on four of them examples of situations or
places that are similar, for them, to ‘being at home’
Ž
.
e.g. being in a restaurant . On the other four cards
they were asked to write down situations and places
that, for them, are the opposite of ‘being at home’
Ž
.
e.g. being in a crowded place . Then the therapist
Ž
.
added one card ‘to be at home’ to the pile of cards.
From this pile Tally and Lilly picked up three cards
at a time and wrote down on a form: what, for her,
is associated with two of the cards and is the
Ž
.
opposite of the third card e.g. quiet ; how much of
Ž
.
this e.g. quiet does she have in her present home
Ž
.
on a scale of 1]7 , and how much of this would she
Ž
.
like to have in her ideal home on the same scale .
Analysis of the tasks
The analysis of the Location Task is based on the
assumption that people construe the presence of
places in the spatial terms by which they experi-

ence their bodies see Cassirer, 1971 , and project
this reference on the task board of the Location
Ž
.
Task
see Figure 1 . The graphic configuration of
the
task
makes present to
the
interviewee a
schematic layout of both a place and a human
body: it generates the fundamental dichotomies of
insideroutside,
corerperiphery,
frontrback
and
Ž
rightrleft. The interviewee can add the uprdown
dichotomy by writing on the stickers the appropri-
ate level of the places that he or she wants elevated
w

or sunken underground
e.g. q1, q2, y1, etc. .
Each region is invested by the interviewee with a
unique meaning: the front is assumed to be con-
strued as the public presentation of the place, while

the back is the concealed, intimate region

Goffman, 1959 . The right side is supportive of the
system, while the left side breaks away from
Ž
.
the system see Hertz, 1979; Lawrence, 1991 . The
inside is a region of belonging, while the outside
makes available disassociation.

of
the

is
performed
by

Ž
Slater 1969 , which maps the data of the grid the
.
data on the resultant form of Tally and Lilly on a
Ž
.
spherical surface see Figures 3 and 5 . The inter-
pretation is based on the definition of clusters of
constructs and elements according to their relative
position on the sphere. These clusters provide an
indication
of
the
subject’s
superordinated
con-
structs of ‘being at home’ and of ‘being in the
Ž
.
desired ideal home’.
FIGURE 2. Tally’s Location task
Tally’s Location Task
Tally’s desired home has a simple spatial configura-
tion. It consists of one floor, the centre of which is
not developed, while the rooms are adjacent to the
Ž
.
envelope borderlines of the house. A long corridor,
leading from the entrance to the parent’s bedroom
divides the house into two main areas: the right
and the left. The right area consists of the children’s
quarters, gym, storage and shelter, while the left is
the public]social part of the house and includes the
kitchen and the living room. On the left, outside the
house, Tally has placed the houses of the neigh-
bours. The striking polarity of the right and left
zones highlights Tally’s preoccupation with the con-
flict between her needs to belong and receive sup-
port on the one hand, and her search for autonomy
on the other. This is also reflected in her REP. The
spatial configuration as a whole expresses her fear
of being engulfed by the home. This is deduced from
her positioning of the most important places on the
borderline between inside and outside, the numer-
ous doors and windows and the complete disregard
of the central zone. Placing the parent’s bedroom in

A. Peled and H. Schwartz 
91
FIGURE 3. Tally’s REP
the intimate back zone expresses Tally’s longing for
the intimacy of couple relations. On the other hand,
her positioning of all activities that are linked with
‘being together with the others’ on the left zone of
Ž
the house with its inherent meaning of breaking
.
away
from
the
system 
reflects
her
anxieties
and difficulties on the interpersonal level. It also
expresses her need to counterbalance the sense of
belonging evoked by the parent’s bedroom and the
nursery. It was therefore interpreted by the thera-
pist as a defensive positioning attesting to Tally’s
need for autonomy.
Tally’s REP
The results of the REP indicate that ‘being in the
present home’ and ‘being in the desired home’ are
Ž
.
not far apart on the globe for Tally. The kibbutz,
Ž
.
however, is far
on the globe
from being in the
desired home, and is linked up with being in the
Ž
.
present home, work E
and living free of charge
Ž
.
14 . The distribution of the results on the globe
reflects Tally’s ambivalence with regard to the
kibbutz. It was ‘home’ for her, in a supportive,
consumer’s sense, yet she felt restricted there and
found it hard to trust others. This frustration of her
emotional needs made it difficult for Tally to regard
the kibbutz as her ‘home’.
Ž
The spatial configuration of the ideal home see
FIGURE 4. Lilly’s Location task
.
Figure 2 , as well as the meanings of the present
and the desired home construed on the REP, reflect
Tally’s emotional problems. They were also in con-
Ž
cordance
with
projective
tests 
e.g.
Rorschach,
.
T.A.T., H-T-P drawings which revealed Tally’s
immature personality as well as her depressive
condition, her insecurity and need of emotional
relationships, and her fears of encountering rejec-
tion or hostility with which she tries to cope by
avoidance and escape from interpersonal interac-
tion.
Lilly’s Location Task
Lilly’s ideal home is spatially complex. It has three
floors: a basement, a ground floor with rooms in the

Exploring the Ideal Home in Psychotherapy
92
front and in the back of the house, and a balcony
above the back of the first floor.
The front area of the house includes the commu-
nal representational places, e.g. the living room, the
dining room and the entrance. This positioning of
the rooms emphasizes the significance of the front
as an area of self-exposure. The posterior area of
the house includes the private rooms. This position-
ing reflects the link between concealment and inti-
Ž
.
macy that Lilly creates at the back of the house .
This is, once more, reflected in the positioning of
the basement, which is located under the centre of
Ž
.
the house the basement is the family activity room .
The emphasized spatial polarity between the front
and the posterior areas reflects the importance, for
Lilly, of differentiating what is presented to the
public vs intimacy and withdrawal. A similar polar-
ity may be noticed between the ‘downstairs’ and the
‘upstairs’ of the house. While the area ‘downstairs’
offers a hiding place for the family to be together,
the balcony upstairs allows detachment from the
house, as well as a view of the gardens and the sea.
Lilly’s ideal home contains a representational zone
at the front intended for guests that is close to a
Ž
populated area nearby
neighbours and institu-
.
tions , yet the entire house is surrounded by a tall
concrete wall with thick bushes that provide a
Ž
.
strong protective boundary fortification! between
herself and her environment. This enables Lilly to
defend the inside of the house and have control
over incoming visitors.
Lilly’s REP
According to Lilly, these places are crowded with
people who are not familiar to her.
Both tasks revealed that the basic values which
Lilly wanted to realize at home were security and
control. She expressed the need to live in quiet and
pastoral places where she could feel protected.
Integration of the results in the
psychotherapy
Tally
When the ecoanalytical findings were discussed
with Tally, she reacted with a flow of memories.
She talked about the place where she had grown
up; she lived there until, at the age of 15, she had
immigrated to Israel with her family. She grew up
on a very large agricultural farm in Africa, which
FIGURE 5. Lilly’s REP
was owned by her parents. One would get to the
family house via a very long road, on the right side
of which were a pool, tennis courts and a play-
ground for children. The quarters of the workers
and their families were located on the left side of
the road. Taking this road, she used to travel to the
orchards with her father, and in that playground
she used to play with the children of the workers,
her childhood friends. It then became obvious that
the desired home she had designed in the Location
Task had a spatial structure similar to that of her
family’s farm, and even more obvious was that the
landscape of the kibbutz was similar to that of her
parents’ farm. It seemed that Tally did not only
look upon her childhood home as her ‘desired home’
but also tried to reconstruct her childhood environ-
ment in this particular kibbutz, attempting to fulfil
her fantasy of ‘going back to paradise’. However,
despite the spatial similarity between the farm and
the kibbutz, the social reality of the latter was
much tougher than she had expected. It seems that
Tally internalized an expectation that she would be
considered worthy of special privileges. Inevitably,
this attitude was rejected by the kibbutz members
Ž
.
after all, they were not her father’s farm hands! .
Ž
.
After her father had died when she was 27 and
Ž
.
her boyfriend had left her when she was 28 , the
situation became almost unbearable. She broke
down and developed a depressive reaction.

A. Peled and H. Schwartz 
93
Working through the ecoanalytical indications
with Tally threw light on the motives behind her
choice of the kibbutz as her potential home, as well
as on some of her interpersonal problems within it.
It revealed Tally’s nostalgia and her inclination
to reconstruct her childhood environment in her
desired home. After working out the mourning over
her many losses, Tally decided to stay on the kib-
butz and to develop more realistic expectations from
its members. She also revived her relationship with
her boyfriend, whom she eventually married.
Lilly
The therapist began by discussing with Lilly her
desired home. She mentioned that both tasks indi-
cated that Lilly would like to have control, security
and familiarity within her home, and also that she
seemed to be afraid of a possible intrusion or pene-
tration to her home by strangers. Lilly immediately
associated the test results with the rape she had
experienced. For the first time during her therapy,
and perhaps during her life, she spoke about the
incident in detail, expressing guilt feelings for
allowing it to happen. She considered her fear of
strangers and the need for protection within her
home as a consequence of the rape, and was also
able to associate the need for control and security
within the home with the need for control and
security within her body. She was especially struck
by the appearance of the tall concrete wall, covered
with thick bushes that hid and protected the house.
She associated it with her sexual inhibitions saying
that she almost never allowed her sexual partners
to penetrate her. She understood that she probably
perceived her partners as ‘potential rapists’ and
desired to keep her body sealed.
Discussion
The use of the ecoanalytical procedure has defi-
nitely helped both patients with whom we dealt in
this article. Not only were their difficulties diag-
nosed using a nonthreatening technique, but eco-
analysis also facilitated insight and provided the
patients with a metaphor that helped them express
their pain symbolically, in a bearable way. Thus,
their recovery was speeded.
Both patients were adolescents when they under-
went a trauma that abruptly changed the course of
a fairly happy childhood. The ecoanalytical proce-
dure, through examining the patient’s relationship
with her ideal home, revealed that these traumas
were critical and ‘formative’ experiences. However,
the two aspects of the subject did not have the same
impact for both patients. For Tally, it was the
development of emotional attachment to her home,
while for Lilly it was the house as a metaphor of her
body.
Tally considered her ideal home a reproduction of
her childhood environment in an attempt to regain
her ‘lost paradise’, and had actually chosen to live
in a place that resembled her childhood environ-
ment. Similar behaviours of immigrants have been
reported in the literature. There is a general agree-
ment that the loss of a house needs to be grieved

On the other hand, Lilly’s case shows that the
spatial configuration of one’s ideal home may
reflect his or her body image. Houses and homes as
metaphors of the body and the self have been dis-
Ž
cussed in the psychoanalytical literature
Freud,

as well as by some

environmental psychologists

.

possible to interpret
in psychoanalytical terms
that penetrating her homerbody was equivalent,

her,
to
penetrating
her
‘psychic
envelope’
Ž
.
Anzieu, 1990 and endangering the cohesion of her
‘inner space’ or her self. She had created, therefore,
a rigid psychological boundary in order to avoid
such a danger. The spatial organization of the two
desired homes reflected the basic conflict of each
patient. While Tally underscored the left]right

dimension meaning: belonging vs detachment ,
Ž
Lilly gave preference to the front and back mean-
.
ing: self-exposure vs hiding and intimacy .
We suggest that knowledge drawn from environ-
mental psychology can be integrated in psychother-
apy, and that ecoanalysis is useful as a projective
and nonthreatening method in this context. We are
currently investigating how different attachment

styles
Bowlby, 1988
influence home attachment
and the spatial configuration of the ideal home. We
hope that this integrative line of thinking will be
helpful for our clients and patients.
