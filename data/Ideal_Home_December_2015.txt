HOME COMMUNITYMy to-do list
for December
The things I‚Äôll be planning, doing 
and shopping for this month
With Christmas on the way, I‚Äôll
be getting prepared, creatinga beautiful mess with the
kids and planning a get-together.ENJOYING THE RUN-UP As with any
h
oliday, I enjoy the planning of Christmas
as much as the event itself. I‚Äôll gladlysacriÔ¨Åce my precious weekend sofa timeto throw myself into a whirl of organising.Anything that requires lists generallymakes me happy and Christmas inspiresa lot of them! I‚Äôll make sure the house issparkling, dealing with dusty skirting and
corner cobwebs that I don‚Äôt mind livingwith the rest of the year, just because Iknow Ma Richmond notices these things.I‚Äôll add whisky to my Ocado order withPa Richmond in mind and put a reminderin my phone to buy both the Radio
Times andTV Times, even though they
both cover all the channels these days,because my sister and I still go throughthem circling what we want to watch.
GETTING HANDS-ON I‚Äôm not a
ha
rdcore crafter, but I do enjoy making
things at Christmas, especially if the
littlest Richmonds are involved. Fromwonky mince pies to paper chains andhome-made cards, ‚Äôtis the season whenthe quality of the results is utterlyoutweighed by the truth of ‚Äòit‚Äôs thethought that counts‚Äô. The children treat me like another kid on theseoccasions, reminding methat ‚Äòwe have to share, AuntieNessa‚Äô if I hog the glue stickand giving me disapprovinglooks if I pretend to sneeze out green glitter. Nowthey‚Äôre old enough to playwith cool stuff, I‚Äôve beenlooking at gifts with my ownsecret agenda. I hope Santabrings the Frozen Sparkling
Ice Castle Lego set this year!HOSTING A WRAP PARTY No, not the
c
elebrity kind, but the sort where you
get folks to bring all the gifts they needto wrap and get down to it in a mass
frenzy of paper, gold ribbon, sticky tape
and snacks. Christmas jumpers, or atthe very least comedy reindeer antlers,are obligatory. As are crooners on thestereo and an abundance of QualityStreet. This way, I hope, I‚Äôll dodgethe usual last-minute wrap panic onChristmas Eve, falling in to bed justbefore the littlest Richmonds wake usall up with shouts of ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs been!!!!!‚Äô.

December SHOPPING IDEAS
Precious minerals
Designers are being inspired
by the Earth‚Äôs natural gems  THE NEXT BIG THING
T H ES T O R YS OF A RTraditional white
m
arble has been a key trend for some time,
but it‚Äôs coloured marble and the swirlinglayers of malachite, onyx and agate thatkeep cropping up in high-end design forfurniture, accessories and wallcoverings.
WHERE WE‚ÄôVE
 SEEN IT Ahead of the
trend was Fornasetti at Cole & Son, which
launched its Malachite wallpaper in 2007.In 2013, Patricia Urquiola commemoratedthe Emilia earthquake with a collection offurniture and accessories made from layersof coloured marble and onyx unearthed bythe disaster. The Albatre wallpaper designby Casamance followed in 2014, succeededby the swirling marble-effect Makranawallpaper from Harlequin this year.
LATEST RELEASES Jonathan Adler has
a
dded malachite-effect accessories to his
quirky collection. Tom Faulkner‚Äôs Siena
side table and Gubi‚Äôs Gamfraseti seriesof side and coffee tables come in green,black and brown marble. The high streethas already caught on, so look out for agatecoasters at Marks & Spencer, black andgreen marble-effect ceramics at H&M,and hints of emerald and onyx-effect agatein John Lewis‚Äô Indulgence collection.LOOK WHAT

mugs after the Ô¨Årst onesleft the production line in1985, Emma Bridgewater
is incredibly proud to be still runningher successful business producingunique pottery and homeware. Setup after Emma tried unsuccessfullyto Ô¨Ånd a birthday present for hermother, the company now producessome of the most recognisable potterydesigns on the market.
‚ÄòI was looking for a special cup and
saucer for my mum‚Äôs dresser, but justcouldn‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd anything I liked,‚Äô explainsEmma. ‚ÄòI realised that there was a gapin the market for pottery that was bothbeautiful and practical.‚Äô
Today, the company is run by
Emma and her husband Matthew Rice,a painter, designer and author. Emmais responsible for the brand‚Äôs signaturespongeware patterns, while Matthewworks on its collections, such as thepopular Black Toast range.
Most of the production work is
still done by hand at the factory inStaffordshire, and each piece isslightly different. The company, oneof the largest employers in Stoke-on-Trent, has recently expanded intoglass, tins, picnicware and homefragrances, as well as a wallpaper andfabric collection for Sanderson.

jumpers and other clothing. ‚ÄòIt wasa fantastic company and a greatexperience,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòA year spentvisiting women knitting in theirhouses was fascinating, but it probablymade me more determined than everto have a factory of my own one day.‚Äô
CAREER PATH
Although Emma never trained asa design
er, she had experimented
with making sponge-painted ceramics,  so when it came to creating the perfect  cup and saucer for  her mother, it seemednatural to design it herself. That led to working from her bedroom in a Ô¨Çat  in southwest London, where she kepta kiln and designed and made mugs,jugs and dishes. ‚ÄòIt was clear early onthat people liked my ideas, perhapsbecause I‚Äôve never been a slavishfollower of fashion,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòI stillÔ¨Ånd it exciting that we make thingsthat people want to buy and havein their homes.‚Äô
Christmas is an important time
for Emma, both personally and forthe company. ‚ÄòChristmas is a timefor feasting and for making a tablelook wonderfully rich and full, so it‚Äôsa great time for buying pottery,‚Äô shesays. ‚ÄòThis year, we have the mostdelicious turkey platter with a largemulticoloured turkey walking acrossit, made using eight separate spongecolours. I think it‚Äôs one of our nicestpatterns to date.‚Äô
Emma will be spending Christmas
at home with the family this year. It‚Äôsan environment that reÔ¨Çects her loveof the simple things in life and her
approach to design. ‚ÄòMyhouse is fairly messy andinformal, with dogs, catsand chickens, anda continuous paradeof children passingthrough,‚Äô she explains.‚ÄòThe kitchen is in themiddle of our house,and it‚Äôs where we love
to come together as a family. Matthewis an extraordinary and energeticgardener. He produces cut Ô¨Çowers andvegetables on a regular basis ‚Äì we cannever keep up with his home-grownbeans and courgettes.‚Äô

oak Ô¨Çooring throughout the ground Ô¨Çoor andinstalling a new bathroom inspired by a smarten suite Sarah and Paul had seen at a b&b.
The couple also replaced the dated kitchen.
‚ÄòAll the cabinets had to be made by handbecause none of the walls are even,‚Äô says Sarah,who added personality t o the space by hanging
a Ô¨Çoral wallpaper behind glass splas hbacks.
Putting right the old decorating mistakes ate
into the couple‚Äôs budget, but it enabled interiordesigner Sarah to use her creative skills to thefull. By decorating rooms in soft neutral shadesand layering texture to add warmth, she hasgiven her home a comfortable, contemporarylook, while never straying too far away fromits period roots. ‚ÄòMy secret is to producemoodboards,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòI spend time tearingimages out of magazines and looking atpaint colours and fabrics. It helps you toplan your look and to keep to your budget.‚Äô
Customisation is another one of Sarah‚Äôs
decorating tricks ‚Äì she has altered many pieces

cabinet for the bathroom, but I didn‚Äôt like  its handles, so I swapped them for hand-craftedones from a specialist maker,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs  not a complicated thing to do, but it can makeall the difference when you‚Äôre trying to bring  a sense of individuality to your home.‚Äô 
A neutral colour scheme throughout the
house sets a calm mood. ‚ÄòI know from otherprojects I‚Äôve done that the best way to createharmony is to use a similar palette of coloursand to ensure there are no harsh distinctionsbetween rooms,‚Äô says Sarah. ‚ÄòA harmoniousfeeling is important in a house like this with somany different levels and nooks and crannies.‚Äô
Sarah also works as a Ô¨Çorist, so as Christmas
approaches, she is busy cr eating garl ands  
of fresh and silk Ô¨Çowers, and sumptuous festive displays. In her own home, every roomis adorned with pretty candle arrangementsand hand-made decorations.

| 61 housetohome.co.uk/idealhomemagazine  DECEMBER 2015Sue and Jonathan Eley hadn‚Äôt
planned on buying a second home,but when Jonathan was browsingthrough the Sunday propertysupplements one day in 2012, hespotted an unusual house and
s h o w e di tt oh i sw i f e .‚Äò L e t ‚Äô sb u yi t , ‚Äôs h es a i djokingly. They were intrigued and not longafter, on a dark winter‚Äôs day, they drove down toRye Harbour in East Sussex to take a look at it.
Steeped in history, the Watch House on the
River Rother overlooks a salt marsh and naturereserve. It was built in around 1835 by TheAdmiralty as a customs house to collect taxfrom ships entering the port of Rye, and as alookout for coastguards spotting smugglers.
The couple loved it instantly. ‚ÄòWe were like
kids at Christmas,‚Äô says Jonathan. ‚ÄòI supposemaybe subconsciously we were looking for
‚û∫a holiday home, even though we weren‚Äôtregistered with any agents. It was a bit of astretch, but we decided to put in an offer and,if it wasn‚Äôt accepted, just say, ‚ÄúOh well, it wasn‚Äôtmeant to be‚Äù.‚Äô To the couple‚Äôs delight, thevendor agreed and by March they were theowners of a 200-year-old Grade-II-listedproperty in need of considerable upgrading.
They started with the exterior and, with
Jonathan acting as project manager, workingclosely with the planning ofÔ¨Åcer and localcraftsmen, they modiÔ¨Åed the chimney stack,repaired the Ô¨Çues, restored the brickwork andreplaced the roof. The house also needed a newboiler and new plumbing, drains and electrics.‚ÄòWe had to repair all the things you don‚Äôt seethat cost a lot of money,‚Äô says Jonathan.
The kitchen was rustic in style, with red
terracotta Ô¨Çoor tiles, low ceilings and black

desperately in need of a brighter look. Localcarpenter and builder Paul Haver Ô¨Åttedkitchen units with oak worktops and laid newÔ¨Çoorboards. The couple kept a range cooker,but removed a large black cooker hood. Someoutdated mosaic splashbacks were replaced
with simple, white, metro-style tiles. ‚ÄòWepainted every surface white to help reÔ¨Çectas much light as possible,‚Äô says Sue.
A new wooden Ô¨Çoor in the kitchen was
extended into the ground-Ô¨Çoor bedroom, andthe shower room on the ground Ô¨Çoor wasremodelled by moving a wall, turning it intoa small cloakroom. This helped enlarge thehallway at the bottom of the stairs, freeingup space for a l arge antique linen press.

As the house took shape, Sue and Jonathan
began looking for furniture. ‚ÄòWe had a goodidea of what we wanted,‚Äô says Sue. ‚ÄòThefurniture here is nothing like our furniture atthe house in London, which is quite colourful.‚Äô

some eBay buys and some from local antiquesand junk shops. Jonathan made a few inventiveitems of furniture that cost next to nothing,such as the platform for their bed and thecoffee table in the living room, which he

it was purely on a whim. ‚ÄòWe were living ina large Georgian apartment at the time,which we loved, but the minute we saw thisdevelopment, we fell for it,‚Äô says Jennifer. ‚ÄòOurapartment needed crucial repairs and we knewwe‚Äôd have to undertake the works or move,so we decided it was time to take the plunge.‚ÄôHowever, the couple didn‚Äôt want to buy thehouse they‚Äôd viewed. Instead, they wanted oneof the four-storey properties, which came witha roof terrace, but none of those were for sale.
Undeterred, Jennifer wrote to the owners
of all the four-storey houses with a propositionto buy, and was thrilled when three of them

very worthwhile exercise if you want a speciÔ¨Åcproperty in a particular street,‚Äô she says.
The house Jennifer and James Ô¨Ånally chose
was an end-of-terrace one, which had beenextended by the previous owners to create agarden room, and with its additional windowsin the rear wall, was by far the lightest and most spacious of the three houses. 
It was a blank canvas of magnolia walls and
cream carpets as the previous owners, who  had visited only at weekends, had never had thechance to put their own stamp on the house.Jennifer and James set about doing this assoon as they moved in. ‚ÄòWe know what we wantwhen it comes to interiors and would never livein a house for a year or so before decorating,‚Äôsays Jennifer. ‚ÄòWe got going immediately.‚Äô
Consequently, the look was pulled together
swiftly, with the couple speedily injecting

There‚Äôs a subtle East-meets-West theme
throughout the house, too ‚Äì a result of Jenniferand James‚Äôs love of travel. ‚ÄòWe wanted to createa soothing refuge, hence the exotic Zen touchesthat bring a sense of serenity,‚Äô says Jennifer.
As with many contemporary builds, the
living room is on the Ô¨Årst Ô¨Çoor. It‚Äôs a peacefulsanctuary, decorated in pale tones and sensualfabrics. ‚ÄòWe retreat here to relax in the eveningsand watch TV,‚Äô says Jennifer.
The ground Ô¨Çoor houses a guest bedroom
and the kitchen, plus a dining room that has 
‚û∫dark purple walls with shimmering silver-greycarpet, and has curtains and blinds in a deepshade of aubergine. Upstairs, there are twobedrooms with en-suite bathrooms and  a balcony, and the top Ô¨Çoor comprises the mainbedroom and en suite, and the roof terrace.
The couple particularly enjoy their home‚Äôs
hassle-free outdoor spaces. Two south-facingbalconies, a roof terrace and a patio are all low maintenance and provide lovely views ofEdinburgh. ‚ÄòWith little need to do any actualgardening, they‚Äôre ideal for me,‚Äô says Jennifer.‚ÄòWe‚Äôve got some topiary on the roof terrace and a few palms in planters, but that‚Äôs theextent of our gardening expertise.‚Äô

For Lesley and Fredrik, coming across their
detached, early 20th-century house in thepaper one Saturday three years ago was a luckyÔ¨Ånd. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôd been looking to move for a while,‚Äôexplains Lesley. ‚ÄòOur children were growingup and we needed a different kind of home toaccommodate our family. As I Ô¨Çicked throughthe property pages, I spotted this 1926 housein a seaside suburb of Stockholm, a 20-minutetrain journey from the city. It wasn‚Äôt an areathat we‚Äôd been considering, but I liked the lookof it immediately and went to view it that day.‚Äô
When she arrived, the house was crowded
with other eager homebuyers. The appeal was

redecorating with cushions, curtains,

Moving in would simply be amatter of furnishing the rooms. ‚ÄòThey had paida lot of attention to the period details, such asthe bleached pinewood Ô¨Çoors and the rusticwood cladding on the walls,‚Äô says Lesley. ‚ÄòThehouse had been loved and cared for, it wasn‚Äôtsterile, and I put in an offer there and then.‚Äô

1Choose your base colour Whether
it‚Äôs Ô¨Çooring or a wall, the base colour
will be the largest area of colour in your
room, so place a generous sample of itonto your board. Including carpet sampleswill help you think about texture, too.
2Add an accent tone A dramatic
contrast or an accent just a few tones
away from your base colour? Use yourmoodboard to play with options andlayer it with swatches of fabric, scrapsof wallpaper and paint colour charts.
3Find the right accessories
These will really set the tone in your
room ‚Äì go for ones that share an accent
colour and stick to a single theme. Don‚Äôtmix styles, or your Ô¨Ånished scheme willlook messy rather than effortlessly eclectic.Design your

balanced scheme, keep 70% of
the elements (say, walls and Ô¨Çoors)
as one colour, then add 20% ina second colour (fabrics) and10% in an accent (access ories).

mixing patterns, use large with 
medium or medium with small,never large with small. Pick printsthat share a colour in common.

Russell and Jannette Harris converted and extended a Grade-II listed
Pure impulse led Russell
and Jannette Harristo become ownersof a derelict water tower,a much-loved locallandmark in the pretty
Cheshire village of Lymm. The couplehad lived in the village for severalyears with their children, James andSophie, and would often pass the tower‚Äì a crumbling, 130-year-old landmarkstraight out of a fairytale.

tower, and when it came onto the openmarket, he impulsively put in a bid andbought the stone structure. Suddenly,he and Jannette found themselves theowners of a Grade-II-listed building,and had to decide exactly what to  do with their new acquisition. ‚ÄòWhatbegan as a whim turned into our ownpersonal Everest,‚Äô admits Russell whenhe describes the ambitious project they took on. ‚ÄòThere were times whenwe thought we might never move in.‚ÄôMAKING PLANS Intent on creating
an in
spirational family home within
the tower, the couple soon realised that it would be necessary to build  a modern extension. Over a period  of five years, they battled with plannersand local opposition, saw severalarchitects come and go, and almostlost heart. However, a chance meeting with Barry Harvey of Redrow Homesproved a turning point. He introducedRussell and Jannette to Ellis WilliamsArchitects (01928 752200; ewa.co.uk),and Julian Baker from the practicecame up with drawings that focused on blending contemporary design with the building‚Äôs traditional features.
Today, the finished two-storey
extension has a sleek curved exteriorfinished in white render, with largepanels of glazing and a distinctiveoverhanging roof. Inside, a series of The old water tower

Russell and JannetteHarris, with their children,James, 25, and Sophie, 20.Russell is a TV presenter/producer and Jannette isa production co-ordinator.WHAT THEY DID
The couple restored the listedtower and built a two-storeywraparound modern extension.
WHAT IT COST
The Harrises paid ¬£138,000for the tower in 1997 and havespent more than ¬£750,000restoring and extending thebuilding, which is now worthmore than ¬£2 million.
‚ñº
A penthouse
is located
on the upperfloors of thewater tower
t oh i - t e c hm o d e r nh o m e
outward-facing living areas occupy the
ground floor, with bedrooms above.CHALLENGING PROCESS ‚ÄòThe tower
w 
as built in 1870 and was sponsored
by the local landed gentry, which iswhy it is so beautiful,‚Äô says Jannette.  ‚ÄòIt was the classic romantic Rapunzeltower, but it was also in desperate needof restoration.‚Äô A detailed report by astructural engineer found the existingwater tank to be expanding due tocorrosion, which had caused somecracking in the stonework. Also, theturret at the top of the spiral stairs hadbeen damaged by movement of theoriginal flagpole. All this called for  a number of specialist companies to  be brought in and led Russell to giveup work and take on the demandingrole of project manager, overseeingthe 60 companies involved in therestoration and build process.
An unsightly selection of mobile
phone antennae on the roof of the oldtower meant that the couple wereentitled to rental income from varioustelecom operators ‚Äì all very usefulwhen faced with such a huge andcostly building project ‚Äì but theproblem of what to do with the uglymasts remained. The architect‚Äôs cleversolution was to conceal them byadding another storey to the existingstone turret and to recycle the heat
Victorian water tower into a stunning contemporary property

KNOW-HOW
A contemporary suspended fireplace
makes a stunning feature in Russelland Janette‚Äôs open-plan living area.
‚ñ†The Focus Gyrofocus wood-burning
fire
was from Diligence (01364 644790;
diligenceinternational.com).
‚ñ†Check with the supplier, an architect
or
structural engineer to ensure that your
ceiling will be strong enough to bear theweight of this type of fire. A suspension
plate should comply with building
regulations and HETAS (hetas.co.uk)
requirements, and will usually containthe insulated flue required for installation. 
‚ñ†A non-combustible hearth, at least
12mm
thick, is required for suspended
wood burners, and should extend
300mm all around the fire front.IN DETAIL SUSPENDED FIRES
Install a striking fireplace, like Russell and Janette didthey produce back into the building‚Äôs 
underfloor heating system.
The main tower was sandblasted and
the original water tank removed, withnew windows punched into the thickstonework. Huge steel frames weighingaround 25 tons were then hoisted intoplace to support the concrete floors, andargon-filled double-glazed units werefitted before foundations could be laid forthe new extension of rendered blockwork. 
Problems occurred at almost every
stage of the project, costs spiralled andthe family watched dispiritedly as recentlyapplied render washed off the walls in therain, setting them back a week. However,after eight long years, the work is finally complete. ‚ÄòSince taking on this project,we‚Äôve become passionate about modernarchitecture and wanted the interior to beas simple and uncluttered as possible,‚Äôsays Jannette. ‚ÄòWe chose a seamless whiteresin floor for the main living spaces andadded colour with lighting. The house hasa tremendous utilitarian look to it thatfeels both contemporary and luxurious.‚Äô
‚Äò W ed i d n ‚Äô tg oo u tf o rd i n n e ro ro n
holiday during the build, and we lived inour work clothes,‚Äô says Russell. ‚ÄòSometimesI wished we‚Äôd never bought the tower,but the camaraderie of the team kept usgoing, and the first time we s oaked in
the roof-top hot tub with its 360Àö views,we knew it had all been worthwhile.‚Äô

|128 DECEMBER 2015 housetohome.co.uk/idealhomemagazineHaving enjoyed many family holidays
in their Devon cottage, Clive andDenise Wells knew they would needto make changes to turn it into a
permanent home for their retirement. Situatedin a village near Kingsbridge, the house wasbuilt in the 17th century, with just one roomdownstairs and a small first floor. Extendedover the years, it now has four bedrooms anda bathroom upstairs, with a kitchen, diningroom and living room on the ground floor.
The couple wanted a space where they could
sit and enjoy the garden, and they found thesolution in a magazine article. ‚ÄòWe contactedthe company featured and Stuart Bayley from Living Space Ar chitects (01392 270420;
livingspacearchitects.com) suggested buildinga modern extension,‚Äô says Denise. ‚ÄòWe lovedhis design.‚Äô The curved single-storey extensionechoes the cottage‚Äôs patio with a sweepingglazed wall and a radial flat roof clad in zinc.
CAREFUL PLANNING Stuart worked closely
with
the conservation officer, and stressed that
the new extension would have little impact onthe older building. The timber windows wereretained and now look out into the extension,while the original external glazed doors fromthe old living room lead into the new space.
Planning permission was granted and the
Wells appointed builder John Oldrieve to dothe work, which began in September 2011and was completed a year later. The patio waslifted and found ations excavated for t he curved
steel and glass structure, which stands on apartially suspended floor slab and opens ontothe new terrace through faceted bifold doors.
The couple paid ¬£624,000 for the property
in 2003 and spent ¬£150,000 on the extension.The cottage is now valued at ¬£900,000.
‚ÄòBuilding the garden room has transformed
our lives,‚Äô says Denise. ‚ÄòWe keep the doors openin summer and it‚Äôs perfect for entertaining.Now everyone wants to spend time in our newextension because not many people have suchfabulous views from their own sofa.‚Äô Denise and Clive Wells brought their period cottage

had Ô¨Çown the nest, Jill andJim Robinson decided thatit was time to remodel andrefurbish their home to createa modern layout that suited
their needs more. ‚ÄòThe old kitchen was on thenorth-facing side of the house and felt dingy,‚ÄôJill explains. ‚ÄòThe dark oak units we‚Äôd inheritedfrom the previous owners felt oppressive, andwe lacked worktop an d stora ge space.‚Äô
The couple decided to add a small, glazed,
oak-framed, garden-room extension to theexisting living room, and to relocate thekitchen to this new space on the south sideof the house. ‚ÄòThe aim was to create the large, bright kitchen with living and diningareas that we‚Äôd always wanted,‚Äô says Jill.
A friend recommended a kitchen designer
to the couple. ‚ÄòWhen we visited the workshop,we were impressed by the craftsmanshipand attention to detail,‚Äô says Jill. ‚ÄòInitially,we considered a contemporary design, butas we‚Äôre both quite traditional, we decidedto opt for a Shaker-style kitchen with somemodern details instead.‚Äô
Now that the kitchen is complete, Jill is
relishing the thought of Christmas. ‚ÄòWe havea huge family gathering planned and I can‚Äôtwait to have them all here,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòMy new

The couple also extended to the side of the

A five-bedroom, Arts and Crafts

WHO LIVES HERE
Ruth and Paul Rodgers, with theirdaughter, Georgie, 19. Ruth is ajournalist and Paul works in radio.
WHAT THEY DID
The couple gutted the existingbathroom and had a room withina room built, providing a seamlessbox in which to create a wetroom.
THE LOOK
Luxurious, with moody coloursand rough and smooth textures.
LESSONS LEARNED
We should have fitted a hand
shower as well as an overhead
one. It would have made cleaningthe shower area a lot easier.THE LAYOUT The basin is on the left
of the room, as is the shower, which isopposite the window and is zoned offfrom the basin by a glass screenMoving into their Arts
and Crafts house sevenyears ago, Ruth and PaulRodgers had big plans forthe bathroom. ‚ÄòIt had beenredesigned in the Eighties
and, apart from being very old-fashioned, thewoodwork was rotten, the shower was a dark,dank cubicle and there was an impracticalthree-quarter-size bath,‚Äô says Ruth.
The couple decided to dispense with the bath
and, inspired by Italian design, made plans fora luxurious wetroom instead. Ruth had seen theÔ¨Ånish she wanted for the walls in the lobby ofan advertising company. ‚ÄòVenetian polishedplaster has a marble-like lustre that looks likecrushed velvet and feels like glass,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòWechose a deep chocolate brown, which shows offthe white basin and chrome Ô¨Åttings beautifully.‚Äô
To complement the polished plaster, the Ô¨Çoor
and shower walls were tiled with tumbled andsealed travertine in a mix of large squares andmosaics. ‚ÄòAlthough it‚Äôs very contemporary, it‚Äôs
got a rustic, Tuscan feel to it,‚Äô says Ruth. ‚ÄòI feellike I‚Äôm on holiday every time I take a shower.‚Äô

OUR SHOPPING DIRECTORYHow we did it 
To achieve a
streamlined effect, our
builders, MG Raffle, built a room
within a room, lowering the ceilingand fitting a stud wall, behindwhich the lighting and plumbingare concealed. As there‚Äôs no shower
tray, a subtle fall had to be built intothe new floor to allow the waterto run away. The shower screenprovides an almost invisible dividebetween the wet and dry areas.Underfloor heating was installedbefore specialist plaster companyDecor Bristol plastered the walls.The project cost around ¬£3,000and took about three weeks.Rustic contrast

The l o oi sc l e v e r l yt u c k e d
away in the corner of the
room so that it‚Äôs the lastthing you see when you
enter the en suite. Above
it, Sam had storage fittedto keep clutter at bay ForSam and Peter Cunningham,
creating their new en-suite
bathroom was just a very smallpart of the bigger job of workingon a self-build hous e‚Äìap r oject
that they began in 2011. ‚ÄòWe
found a house with land to the side and decidedto build the property we wanted,‚Äô says Sam.
The new house presented the couple with
the opportunity to create their ideal en-suite.‚ÄòIn our previous home, the bathroom wascramped with a useless shower,‚Äô explains Sam.‚ÄòThis time we wanted a modern room with  a stylish bath and a powerful shower.‚Äô
Other must-haves included two basins and
a TV. ‚ÄòHaving two basins stops us getting in each other‚Äôs way,‚Äô says Sam. ‚ÄòAs for the TV,we love watching it when we have a bath.‚Äô
The couple came up with the basic design 
of the bathroom with the help of a localdesigner. ‚ÄòWe chose the colour schemeourselves ‚Äì we wanted white and grey to matchthe tiles we‚Äôd chosen,‚Äô says Sam. ‚ÄòWe addedaccessories with touches of green, inspiredby some Orla Kiely bedding we had. Luckily,we were able to get towels to match.‚Äô
The result is a smart space that looks like
it belongs in a boutique hotel. ‚ÄòThis room isa big success,‚Äô says Sam. ‚ÄòWe love the bath,the freestanding tap and the storage unitsabove the loo. There‚Äôs not a thing we‚Äôd dodifferently if we had to start all over again.‚Äô
‚û∫Contemporary cool BATHROOM IDEAS

The monochrome Orla
Kiely print was the original
inspiration for the room‚Äôs
colour scheme. ‚ÄòThe
shades we‚Äôve used make
t h e  e ns u i t eac a l mp l a c e
to be,‚Äô says Sam
Simple touches
Wall-hung taps and oval
countertop basins fit in with
the contemporary scheme How we did it
Knowing we wanted
a modern bathroom was
a good start, but we couldn‚Äôt have
faced actually planning the roomwithout a designer. W e decidedto choose a local company calledGoodey & Howell, where wewere introduced to a brilliantdesigner. He put various layoutstogether for us so that we couldchoose. The building work wasdone by the company buildingthe rest of the house, and weused the bathroom company‚Äôs tiler.From start to finish, the room took a month to complete, and it costaround ¬£6,000 to install.Napoli bath, ¬£2,400; Napoli

It‚Äôs a great way to get  a feel for the scale and impact of different designs, from large-format neutrals to patchworks of pattern.

tiles are unconvincing, check out the ones at Topps Tiles. New technology is making it possible to reproduce the texture and look of natural materials more realistically than ever.

MAKE AND GIVE PICKLES
Pickles are perfect for spicing
up leftovers, as part of a buffet or
just as a late-night snack snaffled
straight from the jar. Simple to
make, you can eat them straight
away, but they‚Äôre even tastier if left
to mature for a couple of weeks.  
SPEEDY PICKLING VINEGAR
Make this all-purpose picklingliquid first, then use it as a base for
theother recipes. This makes 800ml
and the ingredients cost around ¬£4.
1Put the following ingredients in
a large stainless-steel pan: 500g
granulated sugar; 350ml cidervinegar; 350ml white wine vinegar;10g fresh root ginger (in chunks); zest of 1 large orange; 2 bayleaves; 1tbsp whole allspice berries;1 cinnamon stick, and 1tsp cloves.2Stir well with a wooden spoon until
all the sugar has dissolved.3Put on a high heat and simmer for
five minutes, stirring. Leave to cool.4Using a sieve, a jelly bag or muslin
in a funnel, strain out the spices. 
PICKLED ONION RINGS
Easier to serve ‚Äì and eat ‚Äì than
whole pickled onions, you can lift
the slices out of the jar with a fork Crunchy pickles are a store-cupboard essential at Christmas. Beautifully presented,
they make a thoughtful, inexpensive gift that doesn‚Äôt require skill in the kitchen

Sorbus ‚ÄòWisley Gold‚ÄôSorbus (or rowan) are
decorative deciduous treeswith autumn and winterberries in a variety of colours,including white, pink, orangeand blue, while the red berriesare a winter favourite withbirds. Many Sorbus have smallspring flowers, too.
HOW TO GROW Sorbus trees do
best
on fertile, well-drained soil, not
unlike on a mountain slope. Although
they appreciate moist summers, theydon‚Äôt like chalky soils or damp soilaround the roots. They prefer full sunor dappled shade, and can cope withexposure. As many species of rowanare quite compact, they‚Äôre ideal forsmall gardens. Underplant withearly flowering hellebores or bulbs,such as crocus. A good tip from theVictorians was to plant them ona mound to ensure good drainage.

home this Christmas with connected speakersGirl About Tech explains‚Ä¶
WHAT ARE THEY? Listening to
music in every room used to mean one
of three things ‚Äì having an expensiveaudio system installed, wearing aWalkman at all times or turning upthe hi-Ô¨Å to ‚Äò11‚Äô. But thankfully foryour bank balance, social skills and
neighbours, you can now get yourselfa multi-room system. Place its wirelessspeakers around your home and youcan connect to them to send a singlesong to one or more speakers atthe same time. Some systemsalso let you play different music indifferent rooms, all controlled by  just one smartphone or tablet.
WHAT DO I NEED? You can start
out with just a single speaker and addas you go, but be aware that systemsoften aren‚Äôt cross-compatiblewith other brands, and will varyin terms of qualilty and functions.
Powerful Wi-Fi-based systems
such as Sonos, will let you sendmusic from different sourcesto different places, so youcan send a Spotify playlistto your living room, localradio to the kitchen andt r a c k sf r o my o u ri T u n e slibrary to the bedroom.Traditionally, these systemsrequired a ‚Äòbridge‚Äô ‚Äì a box thatplugged into your router ‚Äì however,these are increasingly scarce.
More simplistic multi-room
speakers, like those offered byPhilips and Ruark, are easierto set up just by pressing a fewbuttons on the speaker itself,b u tt h e yo n l yl e ty o us t r e a mthe same track between places. Multi-room

FEATURE AMY CUTMORE ILLUSTRATIONS MONIKA ROE2CONNECT
THE SPEAKERS
In the case of Wi-Fi systems, Ô¨Årst
download the free companion app
and make sure your smartphone ortablet is connected to your homeWi-Fi network. Now power up your
speaker, open the app and select‚Äòadd a new speaker‚Äô ‚Äì you mightneed to press a pairing button onthe speaker, too. Some systemshave an extra step that optimisesthe sound depending on whereyou place the speaker in the room.CHOOSE
A SYSTEM
The multi-room system you
pick will depend on what‚Äôs most
important to you. Do you value supreme
audio quality over everything else, orare you after something that‚Äôs easy,fun and affordable? Do you want similarspeakers in each room, or wouldyou prefer a wider range of options?Samsung, for example, lets you addsoundbars and TVs to its system,while Philips and Panasonic bothinclude CD players in their line-up.1

MULTI-ROOM 
SY
STEMSCREATE ZONES
Once you‚Äôve added a few
speakers, you‚Äôll usually havethe option to group them
together ‚Äì for example, by room ‚Äì
so they‚Äôre easier to control.
Some
systems also let you pair up
individual speakers to re-create
left-right stereo separation or
even a full 5.1 surround-soundexperience. However, you might 
be limited in the number of
speakers that will play the same
song at once. In the case of Philips‚Äô
Izzy basic Bluetooth system, you can
group together up to Ô¨Åve speakers,
whereas for others, there‚Äôs no limit! 
SUBSCRIBE TO
MORE MUSIC
With your music collection easier
to access than ever, it‚Äôs inevitable
you‚Äôll tire of your own library of songs
‚Äì yes, even Everybody (Backstreet‚Äôs
Back). That‚Äôs why lots of multi-room
speakers can be used alongside music
services like Spotify, TuneIn Radio
and Google Play Music, putting
millions more (and possiblyless-embarrassing) tracks at your
disposal. Once you‚Äôve subscribed,
systems like Sonos and Bose will
let you access the service through
their controller app. Also look out for
speakers that support Spotify Connect.
These stream tracks from your Spotify
account directly over Wi-Fi, rather than
using your phone as a medium, so when you 
go to answer a call, the tunes won‚Äôt stop.4CONVERT OLDER 
EQUIPMENT
Plenty of wireless systems
‚Äì such as those fromDenon, Samsung and Pure‚Äì let you integrate olderequipment via a n adaptor.

Always place lit candles well away from foliage, furniture, curtains and soft furnishings,and always out of draughts Keep candles out of reach of children and pets  Never leave 
a burning candle unattended Keep candles away from hair and clothing  
Always place candles upright in suitable holders that can‚Äôt easily
fall over  Always be sure that candles are properly extinguishedBE
