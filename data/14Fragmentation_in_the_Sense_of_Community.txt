Abstract: 
Planning has the power to prevent or reduce many physical and social problems 
associated with urban regeneration. By addressing issues such as poor 
infrastructure, lack of public space, and social inequality, planning can also help 
prevent potential future social problems. As a result, neighborhoods play a 
fundamental role in finding solutions to these problems.  Unfortunately, recent 
rent-oriented urban regeneration practices carried out in Turkey have 
exacerbated these issues. This makes it even more critical to prioritize 
thoughtful planning in future urban development. This study aimed to test the 
theoretical assumption that different spatial designs produce distinct forms of 
neighborhood-level relationships through a sense of community in Eskisehir 
Neighborhood (Turkey). Firstly, we analyzed the effect of neighbor relations on 
the sense of community in residential areas within an urban regeneration project. 
Next, we examined a neighborhood located in the same area where the 
demolition process has not yet begun, and which still maintains its traditional 
characteristics. According to our findings we concluded that the sense of 
community has an impact on social interaction, community attachment, and 
community identity in single-family housing areas, whereas neighbor relations 
in housing estate areas only affect community attachment.

INTRODUCTION 
In spite of recent urban regeneration efforts, many policies and practices 
are still being maintained without proper planning and qualified projects, 
which hinders the elimination of physical and social problems in cities. 
Policies that focus on rent and gentrification are exacerbating income 
inequality, environmental deterioration, and loss of community and 
belonging. These challenges have arisen from the policies that have emerged, 
resulting in displacement of low-income residents, weakened neighbor 
relations, and discrimination against marginalized groups. As a result, some 
urban regeneration applications have merely relocated the same issues to 
another area or even destroyed neighborhoods that require encouragement and 
support  (Jacobs, 1961, pp. 270-271). The neglect of these spaces has led to

increased isolation of individuals, and relying solely on construction 
exacerbates the situation. 
This study argues for human-oriented urban regeneration with a focus on 
creating a sense of community. The study also examines the transformative 
effects of the new structural environment created in urban regeneration areas 
on neighbor relations and the sense of community. We are investigating “the 
possibility of communities saving us from the disintegrating forces of modern 
society, such as materialism, individualism, and market-oriented greed” 
(Harvey, 1997). The study concludes that by prioritizing neighbor relations 
and a sense of community, human-oriented urban regeneration can counteract 
these negative societal forces and create more livable and sustainable urban 
areas. The exclusion of people and places from policy implementation is a 
major problem in urban regeneration, which can result in the expansion of 
problem areas. The planning issue is evaluated as a reason for disintegration, 
particularly in urban regeneration areas in Turkey. Finally, the study provides 
practical evidence through field research to support the theoretical framework. 
The study examines the potential of New Urbanism as an alternative 
approach for urban regeneration areas in Turkey. The study's originality lies 
in evaluating both housing estate and single-family housing areas in the 
context of creating a sense of community through neighborhood-level 
planning. The neighborhood represents livability in the human-space-network 
triangle  (Jarvis,  Cloke et al., 2009, p. 209), and the addition of single-family 
housing to the study area makes the difference more striking compared to 
monotonous uniformity of mass housing estate (Lee, 1968, p. 243). This 
evaluation suggests that New Urbanism could be an alternative to eliminate 
problems in urban regeneration areas while preserving traditional 
characteristics within the framework of careful improvement.

ON 
NEIGHBORHOOD 
AND 
NEIGHBOR 
RELATIONS: DISINTEGRATION IN THE SENSE 
OF COMMUNITY 
The neighborhood, designed to enhance social interaction and inclusivity 
in urban life, originated in the early 20th century (Zayed, 2015, p. 158). 
However, rapid urbanization, industrialization, and modernization have 
altered neighborhoods, especially in densely populated housing estate areas 
resulting from urban regeneration. Despite growing vertical spaces, 
community bonds weaken, and neighbor relations disintegrate in these 
settings. 
Recent studies emphasize the need to prioritize neighbor relationships and 
a sense of community in urban development to tackle urban crises. Current 
urban policies often prioritize projects over people (One of the reasons for the 
failure of project-focused processes is their isolation and segregation from the 
city. Often, new projects are built to escape these failures or improve the 
process, but this approach only repeats the same mistakes. In this case, it is 
necessary to patch up these projects like mending a piece of cloth while 
simultaneously strengthening the fabric around them (Jacobs, 1961: 392)), 
leading to issues like unfair rent distribution, alienation, unused spaces, and 
stagnation. These problems are not confined to a single country, indicating the 
emergence of a global urban crisis. The New Urbanism Movement, which 
emerged in the 1990s in the United States, offers an alternative to traditional 
urban development models. It responds to post-World War II suburban

planning by drawing inspiration from traditional small towns (Christoforidis, 
1994, p. 429). New Urbanism focuses on good urban design, incorporating 
aspects of growth management, environmental protection, and urban 
revitalization (Ellin, 1999, p. 93). It emphasizes human-scale urban priorities 
over modern conditions like automobiles (Varma, 2017, p. 250). This 
approach promotes regular housing intervals, walkable commercial areas, and 
mixed-use developments, reducing dependence on cars and encouraging 
community interactions (Garde, 2006, p. 35; https://www.cnu.org/). New 
Urbanism operates on assumptions about how people interact with each other 
and their environment (Lund, 2003, p. 414) and emphasizes the importance of 
appearance and atmosphere in designing urban spaces. In summary, advocates 
argue that rebuilding the lost sense of community involves constructing social 
capital through well-planned urban environments (Talen, 1999). Effective 
spatial planning and regulation can impact social interactions, fostering 
connections and community (Łucka, 2018). The complexity and ambiguity of 
the concept of emotion presents a challenge in creating a coherent 
understanding of community, and contemporary communities can no longer 
be described using pre-industrial face-to-face relationships in rural areas. 
Instead, new forms of relationships are emerging in crowded and expanding 
cities of modern society (Etzioni, 1994). 
The concept of sense of community is an interdisciplinary field originating 
from responses to social and psychological challenges in modern societies 
(Cohrun, 1994, p. 92). Proposed by Sarason (1974, p. 157), it refers to 
individuals' perception of similarity and interdependence with others, a feeling 
of being part of a dependable and stable structure. McMillan and Chavis 
(1986, p. 9) expanded Sarason's concept, defining it through four dimensions: 
membership, influence, reinforcement, and shared emotional connection. 
However, measuring this emotion remains challenging due to its subjective 
nature, leading researchers to focus on its psychological dimension and 
influencing factors. It has gained popularity and applicability in various fields, 
including social psychology, urban planning, and public health. The sense of 
community can arise based on physical or social characteristics, such as shared 
interests or the proximity of living spaces (Kim, 2001, p. 11). In contemporary 
studies, distinguishing between "community of interest" and "community of 
place" (Glynn, 1986, p. 342) might not be adequate to grasp the full sense of 
community. Efforts have been made to understand the components and 
influencing factors of community sense. Researchers have emphasized the 
connection between physical planning and community sense through studies 
conducted by various scholars (Abu-Ghazzeh, 1999; Baum and Valins, 1977; 
Festinger,  Back et al., 1950; Fischer, 1977; Fleming,  Baum et al., 1985; Gehl, 
2011; Hallman, 1984; Hillier and Hanson, 1984; Homans, 1961; Kenen, 1982; 
Marcus and Sarkissian, 1986; Plas and Lewis, 1996; Rapoport, 1990). These 
studies explore the impact of the environment on human consciousness, 
attitudes, and behaviors (Talen, 2000, p. 172). While physical designs alone 
cannot create a sense of community, they can encourage variables contributing 
to its development (Talen, 1999, p. 1372). Previous studies have used the 
physical environment as a tool to understand individual well-being, but they 
have not focused on the relationship between environmental variables and the 
sense of community. Moreover, the sense of community has not been 
systematically and empirically investigated in various disciplines, particularly 
in urban studies and planning (Plas and Lewis, 1996, p. 109).  
Living in close proximity doesn't guarantee mutual interest, genuine 
connection stems from interpersonal communication. This communication, a 
fundamental aspect of community, emphasizes social interaction (Cabrera and

282 
IRSPSD International, Vol 13 No.1 (2025), 279-302 
 
Najarian, 2013, p. 427). Social interaction, which includes both formal and 
informal encounters occurring in public or semi-public spaces, demands 
shared emotional bonds (Kim, 2001, p. 24; 2007, p. 208). Compact urban 
designs fostering neighbor activities enhance social interactions and a stronger 
sense of community (Brown and Cropper, 2001, p. 403). The sense of 
community is also influenced by social interaction, as people tend to interact 
more with their neighbors when they feel a strong sense of community (Unger 
and Wandersman, 1985, p. 157). Without social interaction, it is challenging 
to create or maintain a sense of community in the neighborhood (Zaff and 
Devlin, 1998, p. 383). 
The sense of community signifies a unique connection between individuals 
and their social environment in psychology literature (Davidson and Cotter, 
1986, p. 608). Attachment refers to residents' emotional connection to their 
neighborhoods, fostering a feeling of belonging and involvement in their 
community (Kim, 2001, p. 18). In this sense, it always has a cognitive aspect. 
This feeling is particularly important in shaping and preserving the identity of 
a historic locality (Tansukanun, 2022, p. 152). In other words, attachment 
emotionally connects individuals to a place while also bringing along the 
ability of this place to support their identities (Dameria,  Akbar et al., 2022, p. 
26).Attachment to living space is defined as the psychological well-being 
experienced by the subject due to the presence, proximity, or accessibility of 
the object, and the distressing condition due to the absence, distance, or 
inaccessibility of the object (Giuliani, 1991, p. 134).  
Community attachment encompasses both strong and weak social ties, 
including casual social contacts, contributing to residents' sense of belonging 
(Rogers and Sukolratanametee, 2009, p. 326). 
Community identity is the unique blend of neighborhood features and 
residents' individual traits that create a distinct unity, making the community 
more than just its individual parts (Wiesenfeld, 1996, p. 341). It represents the 
personal and collective identity that emerges within a specific geographical 
area with its distinctive character. Community identity is directly related to 
both the concept of self and the identity of the space (Kim and Kaplan, 2004, 
p. 315), expressing a binary construct that involves individual and collective 
perspectives (Puddifoot, 1995, p. 361). It is the relationships in people's life 
circles that define the identity of the neighborhood, including the content and 
power of these relations. Community identity is seen as a step in the continuity 
of the community order (Kallus and Law-Yone, 2000, p. 820). When residents 
identify with the neighborhood's character, a sense of community naturally 
emerges (Kim and Kaplan, 2004, p. 315). 
In summary, the idea that neighborhood planning can affect the sense of 
community emphasizes that all the changes in the city affect the neighborhood 
level (Myerson, 2005), and it highlights the importance of urban regeneration, 
the limitations of approaching social problems with physical solutions, the 
value of neighborhood social networks, and the importance of citizens' 
participation in this process (Rohe, 2009, p. 209). Therefore, in the next part 
of the study, we will discuss the importance of planning in urban regeneration 
to support these ideas, based on Turkey's urban regeneration practices.

IMPORTANCE OF PLANNING IN URBAN 
REGENERATION AND URBAN REGENERATION 
PRACTICE IN TURKEY 
The shift towards people-centric planning and regeneration, encompassing 
economic, political, socio-cultural, and socio-psychological dimensions, 
gained momentum post-World War II (Roberts, 2000, p. 14; 2017, p. 19). The 
regeneration process was categorized into different periods, starting with the 
reconstruction period of the 1950s, which involved the restructuring of old 
urban areas based on master plans. The revitalization period of the 1960s 
continued with on-site renovation and neighborhood renewal plans, followed 
by an emphasis on comprehensive urban renewal in the 1970s. The 1980s saw 
the development of large-scale projects, while the 1990s focused on a more 
comprehensive urban regeneration and integrated improvement approach. In 
the 2000s, the regeneration process was dominated by large-scale projects 
within the framework of small-scale plans. However, Turkey's regeneration 
and planning practices have taken a different course from the processes 
outlined in Western literature, as noted by Roberts (2000). 
The increased prominence of cities in Turkey has led to a rise in migration 
from rural areas to urban centers (Tekeli, İ., 1982, p. 85). The country's 
integration with capitalism after the war (Keskinok, 2006, p. 69) has resulted 
in rapid urban growth and the emergence of residential problems, particularly 
in the form of gecekondu (squatting) that first appeared in large cities. Despite 
attempts to manage these issues through legal regulations until the 1980s, the 
problems persisted and even intensified with the inclusion of urban areas in 
capital accumulation through economic liberalization during the same period 
(Kurtulus, 2006, p. 9). Consequently, urban development in Turkey began to 
be characterized by large-scale projects and enclosed housing estates 
(Yalcintan,  Cavusoglu et al., 2014, p. 64). In the 2000s, regeneration practices 
grew due to EU harmonization, yet projects became fragmented and income-
based, lacking a comprehensive plan (Urbanization-Council, 2009, p. 32). 
This approach reflects what Bugra (2000) calls the "immoral economy of 
urban regeneration." 
Turkey's zoning system primarily focuses on quantitative control of urban 
construction but lacks detailed instructions for specific goals, leading to 
passive plans inadequate for high-quality cities (Bademli, 2007). Citizen 
participation gaps make cities seem like administrators' property, neglecting 
citizen involvement (Gormez, 2001, p. 137). Planning failures, common in 
developing nations, cause urban problems (Keles, 1976). Urban regeneration 
demands a holistic approach, addressing social, economic, and environmental 
factors. Turkey's elitist planning hampers citizen participation (Tekeli, İlhan, 
1991, pp. 1-2), neglecting historic areas and issues like gecekondu. In fact, 
resident participation is essential for the achievement of sustainable and 
efficient urban renewal projects (Baek and Joo, 2021, p. 8).A new approach, 
considering citizens and cultural context, is vital. Regeneration in Turkey 
often lacks specific plans, driven by market forces (Gorgulu, 2009, p. 769). 
Moreover, urban regeneration enhances physical, social, and economic well-
being, vital for neighborhood life quality. 
The concept of a neighborhood has always been a spatial element in 
planning thought. The period between 1880 and 1920 is considered the 
"formative phase" of the neighborhood idea, where it became a political 
assembly point for social reform. During the 1920s to the 1960s, the 
neighborhood was incorporated into social science research and urban

284 
IRSPSD International, Vol 13 No.1 (2025), 279-302 
 
planning studies as a planning unit during the "political activism" process. In 
the 1960s and 1970s, a "vast revisionism" occurred in the neighborhood 
movement, which expanded the area of neighborhoods (Silver, 1985, p. 162). 
Today, there's a return to the 1880-1920 approach, recognizing 
neighborhoods' crucial role in urban regeneration. This return is noteworthy 
in terms of both content and format. Neighborhood planning emerged as a 
response to the monotonous nature of uncontrolled mass housing (Lee, 1968, 
p. 243), and it has been widely practiced in the West. However, it is not 
included in the Turkish plan hierarchy. Nevertheless, the smaller scale of the 
plan hierarchy compared to the master development plan has the potential to 
contribute significantly to local needs and services in both the planning and 
implementation processes. This approach emphasizes the importance of local 
social relations and networks, crucial in tackling urban issues (Rohe, 2009, p. 
216). The placement of lower-income groups in residential areas without 
social equipment and facilities leads to deficiencies and failures in practices 
that largely destroy the existing social structure and its values through urban 
regeneration applications. Therefore, it is essential to address applications in 
the neighbor, community, and neighborhood triangle, as urban regeneration 
areas should be initiated and developed from the neighborhood level, rather 
than large areas, which differs from Turkey's planning system. 
4. 
DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHEISIS  
This study adopts the principle of "design affects behavior" based on 
spatial determinism, which argues that the decisions made by designers will 
not only impact the visual appearance of residents’ lives but will also influence 
their daily routines (Lennertz, 1991, p. 21). The effects mentioned here refer 
to the support of human activities, rather than the behavioral patterns of 
architecture or planning (Marmot, 2002, p. 252). While redesigning or 
planning cannot entirely transform society into a new quality, interventions 
have the potential to significantly impact the lives of those who reside in these 
areas (Konuk,  Olgun et al., 2017, p. 94). Therefore, it is important to examine 
the relationship between the sense of community and spatial determinism to 
determine whether social bonds and relationships, which form the foundation 
of the sense of community, can be established or enhanced through spatial 
design, or if existing bonds can be strengthened by this means. Studies have 
found that physical factors can influence certain dimensions of the sense of 
community. For example, Plas and Lewis (1996, p. 140) found that design 
stimulates the sense of community and that promoting factors associated with 
the structure of the community environment can be achieved through urban 
planning, as evidenced by their research on Seaside, which was the pioneer of 
the New Urbanism Movement. 
Taking into account that social interaction comprises various forms of 
interaction involving neighbors (Unger and Wandersman, 1985; Weenig,  
Schmidt et al., 1990), Haggerty (1982) found that the greater the intensity of 
relationships between neighbors, the more pronounced the effects of social 
interaction and the neighborhood environment will be. Additionally, there are 
studies demonstrating that the use of physical environment facilities enhances 
neighbor relations, and that the cultivation of neighbor relations also impacts 
social interaction (Ahlbrandt, 2013; Greenbaum, 1982; Levine, 1986; Lund, 
2003; Riger,  LeBailly et al., 1981). Research on the topic has shown that the 
use of physical facilities in the neighborhood brings people closer together and 
strengthens neighbor relations, resulting in increased social interaction and a

Maltas Erol & Gormez 285 
 
stronger sense of identity (Gehl, 2011; Pretty,  Bishop et al., 2007; Puddifoot, 
1995). Given that attachment is characterized as a positive emotional 
connection or relationship between residents and their residential 
environments (Shumaker, 1983), certain studies have demonstrated that 
residents develop a stronger sense of attachment when they engage in 
interactions with their neighbors (Unger and Wandersman, 1985). Moreover, 
there are studies suggesting that spatial differences also give rise to changes 
in these behavioral patterns. For instance, neighbor relations differ among 
various types of housing settlements, and this relationship is more pronounced 
in traditional neighborhoods than in others (Bothwell,  Gindroz et al., 1998; 
Langdon, 1997; Lund, 2002; Plas and Lewis, 1996; Talen, 1999). Spatial 
differentiations resulting from physical elements, such as the characteristics, 
design, and amenities of residential areas, influence social interactions among 
neighborhood residents (Ahlbrandt, 2013; Appleyard,  Gerson et al., 1981; 
Michelson, 1970, 1977; Plas and Lewis, 1996; Talen, 1999, 2000; Williams, 
2005). The impact is more significant in low-rise buildings with a wide area 
(Amick and Kviz, 1975) and is higher in traditionally designed neighborhoods 
(Brown and Cropper, 2001; Kim, 2001, 2007; Kim and Kaplan, 2004; Lund, 
2002). Similarly, the degree of attachment varies depending on the location 
(Kim, 2001, 2007; Kim and Kaplan, 2004; Talen, 1999; Williams, 2005). The 
proximity of housing units, such as low-rise buildings, can increase 
attachment due to physical closeness (Williams, 2005). Street designs that 
allow for this closeness also contribute to attachment (Brown and Werner, 
1985). Additionally, having unique values within a neighborhood can increase 
its sense of identity. Research has found that community identity is higher in 
single-family housing residential areas with traditional design (Duncan Jr, 
1973; Guest and Lee, 1983; Kim, 2001, 2007; Kim and Kaplan, 2004). In 
summary, based on the fundamental hypothesis that changes in the character 
of a space can change the direction and nature of the relationships of those 
who use it, this study has developed the following hypotheses and we 
separately tested the proposed research model for housing estate residences 
(H1, H2, H3) and single-family housing residences (H4, H5, H6) to reveal the 
independent effects in the different residential areas (Figure 1): 
H1: Neighbor relations of residents living in housing estate residences have 
a positive effect on social interaction. 
H2: Neighbor relations of residents living in housing estate residences have 
a positive effect on identity. 
H3: Neighbor relations of residents living in housing estate residences have 
a positive effect on attachment. 
H4: Neighbor relations of residents living in single-family housing 
residences have a positive effect on social interaction. 
H5: Neighbor relations of residents living in single-family housing 
residences have a positive effect on identity. 
H6: Neighbor relations of residents living in single-family housing 
residences have a positive effect on attachment.

METHOD 
5.1 
Data collection 
In this study, we empirically tested the hypotheses using Structural 
Equation Modeling (SEM). We provide detailed information about the study’s 
variables and scales, the data collection tool, and the sampling process under 
the following headings. 
5.1.1 
Variables and instruments 
This study utilized existing scales, including the Sense of Community 
Index (SCI), which is one of the most important instruments for measuring 
and analyzing the sense of community. The SCI was designed based on the 
theory developed by McMillan and Chavis (1986), and it has been used in the 
majority of previous studies that measure the sense of community. Thus, we 
used the items developed from the relevant index and made some adaptations 
based on socio-cultural characteristics specific of Turkey. In this context, a 9-
item scale adapted from Buckner (1988) and Prezza,  Amici et al. (2001) was 
used in this study to measure neighbor relations. As previously noted, sense 
of community was defined as consisting of three dimensions: social 
interaction, community attachment, and community identity. Social 
interaction was measured using a 7-item scale adapted from the studies of Kim 
(2001) and Garip (2010). Community attachment was measured using a 5-
item scale adapted from the studies of Kim (2001) and Cross (2003). 
Community identity was measured using a 5-item scale adapted from Yang 
and Xin (2016). All the scales were measured using a 5-point Likert-type 
scale. To collect data, we conducted a five-part questionnaire (demographic, 
social interaction, attachment, identity, and neighbor relations) through face-
to-face interviews with voluntary participants. 
5.1.2 
Sampling process 
The population of our study consisted of residents aged 18 years or older 
(N=2209) living in the Karapinar Neighborhood of Odunpazari Municipality

Maltas Erol & Gormez 287 
 
of Eskisehir. We determined our sample size using the SEM criterion (10:1) 
and collected a total of 576 surveys (280=housing estate residential area, 
296=single-family housing residential area). Due to time and economic 
constraints, we used convenience and snowball sampling methods to select 
our sample for the study. We analyzed the collected data using SPSS 25.0 and 
AMOS 23.0.  
5.2 
Data analysis 
5.2.1 
Pilot study 
We administered 121 surveys, with 45.5% of the responses from housing 
estate residences and 54.5% from single-family housing residences. We 
conducted several analyses including the elimination of incorrect or 
incomplete questionnaire forms, assessment of normality, reliability, validity, 
and t-tests. We found that our data distributed normally, all scales used were 
reliable, variables loaded onto dimensions as expected, and responses varied 
based on the participants' residential area. Items with low factor loadings that 
disrupted the distribution between factors and those that reduced reliability 
were excluded from the analysis. Furthermore, we enhanced the 
comprehensibility of some items by revising them based on feedback from 
participants during the pilot study. 
5.2.2 
Main study 
As part of our main study, we collected a total of 576 surveys (280 from 
housing estate residences and 296 from single-family housing residences). 
However, we excluded 62 surveys where the respondents left more than 75% 
of the questionnaire unanswered. Additionally, we excluded 6 questionnaires 
from the study because they disrupted the distribution based on the Box Plot 
analysis results. Therefore, we conducted the analyses with the remaining 508 
surveys (253 from housing estate residences and 255 from single-family 
housing residences). We conducted separate analyses for both residential 
areas. For both residential areas, we performed a check for missing data, tested 
the conditions for normal distribution, checked reliability and validity, 
calculated the average variance extracted (AVE), composite reliability (CR), 
performed discriminant validity analyses, checked WIF values and conducted 
confirmatory factor analysis. Then, we performed hypothesis testing. Finally, 
we used multigroup analyses that allowed comparisons between spaces 
(housing estate or single-family housing) in terms of testing the structural 
model. 
5.2.3 
Main study for housing estate residences 
According to the demographics, 61.3% of the participants were women, 
26.1% were aged between 26-35, 33.2% were housewives. The majority 
(67.6%) of the participants had been dwelling in Karapinar Neighborhood 
between 3-5 years. Also, participants answered ‘yes’ with 49.4% to the 
question ‘Were you living in the same neighborhood before the regeneration?’ 
directed only to the residents’ lives in housing estate residences. In addition, 
73.9% of the participants stated that they owned the house they dwelled in 
(see Table 1).

For housing estate residences, the data met the normal distribution 
requirement that skewness and kurtosis values for the related constructs were 
between -2.0 and +2.0 (Gravetter and Wallnau, 2013); therefore, the data were 
normally distributed and convenient for parametric tests. As a result of the 
factor analysis, we concluded that the items were loaded to the relevant 
structures and there were no items with loading below 0.60 as expected (Hair, 
J. F.,  Black et al., 2013). For reliability, Cronbach's alpha values showed that 
all of the structures in our research had a fair (>0.70) reliability level 
(DeVellis, 2012). The AVE value (>0.50) of each structure provided values 
consistent with our assumptions (Hair, J. F.,  Black et al., 2013). Finally, the 
CR values of all the variables in the research model (>,80) also gave results 
consistent with statistical expectations (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988).

We checked the discriminant validity of the structures within the 
framework of the Fornell-Larcker criterion (Table 3). Accordingly, the AVE 
value's square root for each structure must be higher than the structure's 
highest correlation with any other structure in the model (Fornell and Larcker, 
1981). The results showed that discriminant validity was ensured. We also 
checked the variance inflation factors (VIF) and found that all the values 
related to the structures were below 3; thus, there was no multicollinearity 
issue (Hair, J. F.,  Black et al., 2013). Finally, we performed confirmatory 
factor analysis (see Appendix). Accordingly, the goodness-of-fit values 
(χ2/df=1.730; 
GFI=0.908; 
CFI=0.955; 
NFI=0.900; 
IFI=0.955;

data (Browne and Cudeck, 1992; Hair, J. F.,  Black et al., 2013).

As the final step, we proceeded to the stage of conducting path analyses 
(Table 4). According to the findings of analysis, we found that that neighbor 
relations only had a significant effect on attachment in housing estate 
residences (R2=0.276; p<0.001). Also, when effects of age, employment and 
length of residence are controlled, results don’t change.

For single-family housing residences, the data also followed a normal 
distribution (Table 6). All factors had loadings above 0.60, except for item 3

on social interaction (0.534). However, we chose to retain this item because 
the parameters, including AVE, CR, and reliability, were within acceptable 
limits (Hair, J. and Alamer, 2022). Cronbach's alpha values indicated that all 
structures had a reliable level (> 0.70) (DeVellis, 2012). Additionally, both 
the AVE (≥ 0.50) and CR (> 0.80) values yielded consistent results with 
statistical expectations (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988; Hair, J. F.,  Black et al., 2013).

We used the Fornell-Larcker criterion to test the discriminant validity 
(Table 7), and found that the square root of the AVE value for each structure

292 
IRSPSD International, Vol 13 No.1 (2025), 279-302 
 
was higher than the highest correlation of that structure with any other 
structure in the model (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). Additionally, we found 
that all VIF values were below the upper limit of 5, indicating that there was 
no multicollinearity problem (Hair, J. F.,  Black et al., 2013). We also 
conducted confirmatory factor analysis (see the appendix) to assess the fit 
between the single-family housing residence data and research model 
(χ2/df=2.013; 
GFI=0.895; 
CFI=0.926;

We conducted path analyses to test hypothesis. According to the analysis 
results, neighbor relations have a significant positive effect on social 
interaction (R2= 0.376; p<0.001), identity (R2= 0.204; p<0.01), and 
attachment (R2= 0.388; p<0.001) in single-family housing residences. 
Furthermore, when we include age, employment, and length of residence as 
control variables, we see that the results do not change.

Finally, as part of our analysis, we tested whether there were significant

Our findings indicate that only the effect of neighbor relations on social

effect was stronger for single-family housing residential area, as evidenced by 
the path coefficients (see Table 9).

DISCUSSION  
The findings of our study highlight that different types of neighbor 
relations emerge in different types of settlement areas, in accordance with 
theoretical expectations. As a result, a sense of community is formed at 
varying levels. Previous studies have shown that neighbor relations 
established in traditional neighborhoods are stronger compared to others 
(Bothwell,  Gindroz et al., 1998; Langdon, 1997; Lund, 2002; Plas and Lewis, 
1996). Studies comparing residential areas with traditional characteristics to 
housing estate enclosed living spaces have found that a more individual or 
family-oriented relationship was experienced rather than community-based 
relationships (Low, 2003).  
Based on the findings of our study, we can suggest that living 
environments and residential areas can be designed according to neighbor 
relations. Also, our study's results suggest that single-family housing areas, 
which encourage daily social contact with neighbors due to their physical 
design, may lead to stronger social interaction, identity, and attachment, all of 
which contribute to the sense of community. These findings are supported by 
previous studies which have shown that the impact of spatial differentiations, 
such as the characteristics, design, and physical facilities of a residential area, 
on social interaction  (Kim, 2001) is more pronounced in neighborhoods 
designed with a single-family housing layout (Ahlbrandt, 2013; Appleyard,  
Gerson et al., 1981). Likewise, factors such as the proximity of residences to 
each other, low-rise structures (Williams, 2005), and the layout of streets in 
residential areas allowing for this proximity (Brown and Werner, 1985) 
suggest that the level of attachment varies depending on the location, as these 
design elements also influence the level of attachment (Kim, 2001).  
Another dimension that varies depending on the space is identity, which is 
related to the original values of the neighborhood  (Guest and Lee, 1983). Our 
findings are in consistent with previous studies that have found a higher level 
of identity in single-family housing residences because the authenticity is 
more uniform and standardized in traditional neighborhoods and single-family 
housing areas compared to housing estate residential areas. Therefore, it can 
be argued that low neighbor relations cannot create a sense of identity, as the 
sense of identity arises from neighbor relations and individual relationships 
are established in housing estate residential areas (Pretty,  Bishop et al., 2007).  
In contrast, our study's results suggest that housing estate residential areas 
may only foster a sense of attachment, while compromising other dimensions 
of the sense of community due to various factors, such as a lack of facilities 
and the arrival of new residents from different regions. As the sense of 
attachment is an emotional relationship that is established with a space 
(Hummon, 1992), the continuity of this emotion can be explained by the 
tendency of residents to maintain their closeness to the space (Hidalgo and 
Hernandez, 2001). In this sense, the fact that the residents come from the same 
neighborhood can be considered the factor that creates this sense of 
attachment, as our study focuses on on-site regeneration. 
The discussions mentioned above directly refer to the principle of "design 
affects behavior," highlighting the critical role of well-designed outdoor 
spaces in facilitating social interaction and fostering a sense of community. 
This is consistent with the principles of the New Urbanism movement, 
particularly 
in 
promoting 
community-centric 
urban 
environments. 
Specifically, single-family housing areas, characterized by the encouragement 
of daily social contact among neighbors, tend to foster stronger social 
interaction, identity, and attachment among residents. These findings are in

294 
IRSPSD International, Vol 13 No.1 (2025), 279-302 
 
line with previous research emphasizing the importance of spatial 
differentiation in influencing social dynamics within residential areas. 
Additionally, our findings suggest that housing estate residential areas may 
prioritize fostering attachment over other community dimensions due to 
factors such as limited communal facilities and diverse resident 
demographics. However, they may compromise on fostering deeper neighbor 
relations and a stronger sense of identity compared to traditional 
neighborhoods and single-family housing areas. 
In conclusion, the results of the multigroup analysis based on space 
revealed that only social interaction varies depending on the space. The 
importance of social interaction, which is a key factor in building urban 
communities, is emphasized in our study. In fact, the differentiation of social 
interaction, which forms the basis of the relationship in housing estate 
residential areas and single-family housing residential areas, can be 
considered a very important result in terms of the research, as neighbor 
relations must first exist for social interaction to occur. This aligns with the 
principles of the New Urbanism movement, which advocates for the 
importance of well-designed external spaces and their proper use in increasing 
social interaction and fostering a sense of community. The results of the 
research allow us to answer Harvey (1997), which we previously mentioned: 
The sense of community can only serve as a barrier to social disintegration up 
to a certain level. It would be meaningless to solely look for a solution in the 
sense of community. This is because individualized and rent-based practices 
of dominant paradigms cause the meaning of the sense of community to be 
lost to some extent due to spatial changes, even in residential areas that 
maintain their traditional characteristics.

CONCLUSION 
The issue of urbanization is becoming increasingly significant globally, 
and there is a growing focus on addressing related problems. Urban 
regeneration has emerged as a potential solution to these challenges. However, 
the changing physical environment and living conditions resulting from 
urbanization can impact people's social networks and habits. Consequently, 
the neighborhood level, based on social relationships, must be revisited. 
Focusing on the sense of community is crucial in engaging individuals in 
policies like urban regeneration, as initiatives solely concentrated on physical 
and financial outputs may neglect human relationships. In this context, 
research on social relationships within neighborhoods and their importance 
can help us comprehend the impact of urban regeneration policies on human 
interactions. Mumford (1954, p. 257) emphasized that sharing physical space 
is the most fundamental social tie, and Festinger,  Back et al. (1950) found 
that chance encounters often initiate relationships between neighbors. Homans 
(1961) noted the significant role of intimacy in shaping socialization patterns 
among neighbors, and Abu-Ghazzeh (1999) found that close physical 
proximity determines common interests and communication among 
neighbors. Similarly, Henning and Lieberg (1996) found that geographical or 
spatial proximity promotes spontaneous gatherings among neighbors. 
However, advancements in technology, communication, transportation, and 
lifestyles have made measuring and establishing neighbor relations at the 
neighborhood level more complex. This has led to a diminished significance 
of neighborhoods, resulting in the "shrinking" of cities. Most people's 
relationships

activities

neighborhoods, leading to the loss of neighborhood-related values (Zayed, 
2015, p. 141). This study aims to examine the impact of urban regeneration 
on the construction of a sense of community in two distinct types of living 
spaces, a housing estate and a single-family housing residential area located 
within the same neighborhood (Karapinar Neighborhood). The research aims 
to measure the impact of new living environments created by urban 
regeneration practices on neighbor relations and how these transformed 
neighbor relations impact the sense of community. The study's findings may 
provide insights into how to prioritize the sense of community when 
considering policies that directly impact individuals. 
The daily practices, expectations, and needs of residents vary in areas 
experiencing or under pressure for urban regeneration. Neighborhoods, 
situated at the intersection of the city and the community, are the basic level 
of analysis for the regeneration strategies or processes followed in this context. 
To investigate the claims of this study, it was necessary to identify a residential 
area within the same neighborhood undergoing regeneration while 
maintaining its structured order. This allowed for measuring the changes in 
the individual-structured environment relationship in response to spatial 
interventions. Our study was conducted in the Karapinar Neighborhood, 
which provided a valuable opportunity for comparison as it underwent urban 
regeneration led by the Odunpazari Municipality of Eskisehir in Turkey with 
the assistance of the Housing Development Administration. This area is 
particularly significant because the majority of those settling in residential 
areas are residents of the Karapinar Neighborhood. Moreover, the on-site 
regeneration approach utilized in this neighborhood reinforces its importance 
for our study. We selected the Karapinar Neighborhood as our study area for 
several reasons. Firstly, it largely preserves traditional neighborhood 
characteristics and has a homogeneous structure in line with the 
sociodemographic characteristics of its residents, fostering strong solidarity 
and cooperation among the community. Additionally, its geographical 
location, which is very close to the city center, makes it an ideal location for 
our study. One of the primary limitations of our study is that the collection of 
primary data and the resulting findings were limited to a single city and 
neighborhood. Additionally, the use of sampling methods in data collection 
poses further limitations to the generalizability of our findings. 
Based on the comprehensive analysis of urban regeneration practices in 
the Karapinar Neighborhood, Turkey, this study offers significant insights into 
the intricate relationship between spatial design, neighbor relations, and the 
sense of community. The research findings underscore the critical importance 
of fostering strong social interactions and community attachments in urban 
planning initiatives, especially in the context of urban regeneration. One of 
the central conclusions drawn from this study is the nuanced impact of spatial 
designs on neighbor relations and subsequently, the formation of a sense of 
community. Specifically, the research highlights the superiority of traditional, 
single-family housing areas in promoting social interaction, community 
identity, and attachment. These areas, characterized by their physical layout 
and design, facilitate daily social contact among neighbors, fostering a robust 
sense of community. In contrast, housing estate residential areas, influenced 
by factors such as lack of facilities and the influx of residents from diverse 
regions, tend to promote only a sense of attachment, often at the expense of 
other dimensions of community. 
In light of these findings, it is evident that a one-size-fits-all approach to 
urban regeneration is insufficient. Instead, the distinct characteristics of each 
neighborhood must be meticulously considered when devising regeneration

296 
IRSPSD International, Vol 13 No.1 (2025), 279-302 
 
strategies. Within this context, the New Urbanism movement emerges as a 
compelling alternative, emphasizing the significance of neighborhood design 
and the sense of community. By prioritizing well-designed external spaces, 
encouraging social interaction, and nurturing a sense of belonging, New 
Urbanism provides a viable framework for creating livable urban 
environments. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the need for a shift in 
planning paradigms, especially in the Turkish context. It highlights the 
adaptable and transferrable nature of New Urbanism principles (Grant, 2006), 
thereby emphasizing the need for policymakers and practitioners to integrate 
these principles into urban regeneration endeavors, social housing initiatives, 
and the restoration of historical areas. Such integration not only enhances the 
social fabric of communities but also contributes significantly to the 
establishment of sustainable, inclusive, and vibrant urban spaces. In 
conclusion, this research underscores the pivotal role of thoughtful planning 
and community-focused approaches in shaping the future of urban 
development. By acknowledging the intricate interplay between spatial 
design, social interactions, and community identity, urban planners and 
policymakers can pave the way for resilient and harmonious communities. As 
urbanization continues to reshape our cities, embracing the principles of New 
Urbanism offers a promising path forward, ensuring that our neighborhoods 
become not just spaces to inhabit, but thriving communities that foster 
meaningful human connections and a shared sense of belonging. While New 
Urbanism does not offer a panacea, it presents an alternative approach to 
addressing the escalating challenges faced by contemporary cities through 
strategic planning policies, design principles, and implementation strategies 
(Fulton and Policy, 1996, p. 29; Howard, 2005, p. 40). Moreover, the study's 
findings underscore the importance of recognizing the multifaceted nature of 
urban regeneration. Urban development cannot be solely quantified through 
physical and financial outputs; instead, it must encompass the social 
dimensions that define a community. The sense of community, as elucidated 
by this research, serves as an indicator of social integration and cohesion. 
Neglecting this vital aspect in regeneration initiatives may lead to a loss of 
identity and social disintegration, even in areas maintaining their traditional 
characteristics. This understanding necessitates a paradigm shift in how we 
approach urban planning and regeneration, emphasizing the preservation and 
enhancement of social relationships alongside physical improvements. 
Furthermore, public participation and community engagement should be 
central tenets of any urban regeneration endeavor. Involving residents in 
decision-making processes empowers them, ensuring that their unique 
perspectives and needs are taken into account. Participatory approaches can 
bridge the gap between policymakers and the community, fostering a 
collaborative environment where regeneration initiatives align with the 
aspirations of the people they are meant to benefit. 
In conclusion, this study not only sheds light on the complexities of urban 
regeneration in Turkey but also offers a roadmap for future endeavors. By 
recognizing the significance of neighbor relations and the sense of 
community, and by embracing the principles of New Urbanism, cities can 
embark on a transformative journey. A journey where urban regeneration 
transcends the mere construction of buildings and infrastructure, becoming a 
catalyst for social harmony, community resilience, and collective well-being. 
As we continue to navigate the challenges of urbanization, it is imperative to 
prioritize people-centered approaches, ensuring that our cities are not just 
spaces of habitation but vibrant, interconnected communities where 
individuals thrive and flourish.
