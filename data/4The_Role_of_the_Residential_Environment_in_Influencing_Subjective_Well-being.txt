Abstract: To examine the association between community and individual-level residential envi-
ronment in relation to subjective well-being (SWB) amongst 470 elderly migrants in China, this
community-based survey was conducted. The manner and extent to which the SWB of these elderly
migrants is inﬂuenced by their residential environment was the main area of focus. The Scale of
Happiness of the Memorial University of Newfoundland was used to assess SWB. SWB was found
to be associated signiﬁcantly with environmental factors such as social cohesion, closeness to the
nearest facility of recreation, the density of recreation facilities, ﬁnancial facilities, and health facilities.
The health facility density (B = 0.026, p < 0.001) and recreation facility density (B = 0.032, p < 0.001)
had positive associations with SWB, while ﬁnancial facility density (B = −0.035, p < 0.001) had a
negative association. The primary determinants of SWB for elderly migrants ranged from individual
to environmental factors. Through the enhancement of the accessibility to healthcare facilities in their
new homes, in addition to promoting recreational activities and social services, the SWB amongst
elderly migrants could be enhanced further.

1. Introduction
With the development of high-quality cities in China, the pursuit to improve people’s
life and happiness has gradually replaced the simple yearning for wealth. Enhancing
people’s subjective well-being (SWB) has become an important goal of the current govern-
ment’s livelihood construction. SWB is an important psychological index of individual
quality of life, and the term includes affective states, valuations of quality of life of different
people, their residential environment, and the events they encounter [1]. The term SWB was
ﬁrst introduced by Edward Diener in 1984 as being central to a person’s experience, consist-
ing of positive aspects, and a global assessment of a person’s life [2]. In 1995 he modiﬁed
this deﬁnition by also including cognitive evaluations or appraisals of life satisfaction as a
whole, and emotional reactions to life events [3]. In 2006 he developed the latest version,
identifying SWB as a term for different valuations of people’s quality of life, the events that
happen to them, their physical and mental health, and the circumstances in which they
live [4]. Issues regarding the SWB of the elderly have been garnering more attention lately,
as the rapid aging of the population has increasingly become a social challenge [5,6].
There are many factors that affect older adults’ SWB. However, the evidence regarding
the inﬂuence of the factors of residential environment on the SWB of elderly migrants has

been limited, unlike that regarding individual resources, and most studies have focused
on the association between an individual’s attributes and SWB [7,8]. In fact, residential
environment can have a substantial impact on elderly SWB, as they become less mobile due
to deteriorating health status and because they tend to spend more time in their residential
community [9–11]. Previous studies have conﬁrmed that residential environment has a sig-
niﬁcant positive effect on SWB [8,12]. Liu et al., another study based in China, reported that
residential environments have a stronger impact on SWB than do individual attributes [7].
The major environmental factors of SWB included residential environments of good quality
with better socio-economic background in the neighborhood and ease of accessibility to
basic facilities. The SWB of the older adults is highly inﬂuenced by the social and physical
environments, as conﬁrmed by several studies in this regard [7,8]. The physical aspect of a
residential environment mainly focuses on the role of accessibility to local amenities, such
as healthcare centers, banks, and parks, all of which are the locus of most material facilities
related to older adults’ well-being [7,8,13]. For instance, good accessibility to green parks
can provide an open, natural public space, which positively impacts SWB. The accessibility
of a residence to the city center inﬂuences residents’ abilities to easily enjoy various services
and improve residents’ SWB. The social aspect of the residential environment encompasses
interpersonal relationships and neighborhood characteristics [14,15]. For instance, social
cohesion, a measure of an individual’s social environment, can also inﬂuence individual
health and SWB [8,16].
Internal migrants, people who travel a substantial distance but within the country,
account for approximately 18% of the total population in China, and 7% of these internal
migrants, or approximately 18 million people, are elderly [17]. The number of elderly
migrants has grown rapidly in recent years due to the persistence of internal migration
and aging trends in China [7,17]. Neglecting the elderly migrants having migrated to new
cities, the majority of the earlier studies concentrated on the SWB of either the rural elders
or the local elders in China [18,19]. Older adult internal migration is expected to be a
universal phenomenon in China soon, which may affect the health of elderly migrants [5].
Policymakers should be aware of the situation, especially on the implications for elderly
migrants’ SWB. However, it is only recently that evaluating elderly migrants’ SWB has
received academic attention. These migrants were not provided the services and social
beneﬁts enjoyed by the local residents, as a result of the “hukou” restriction, a registry
system of the households in China [5,20]. Impacting the well-being of the elderly migrants
in a much higher manner as compared to the other local elders, the “hukou” system
inﬂuenced inequality amongst the migrants [20,21]. Due to the environmental inequities
and the difﬁculty of the migrants to adapt to the new cities (like interacting with neighbors),
the elderly migrants of China were found by Gao et al. to display lower levels of SWB
compared to the other local elderly (e.g., unequal access to healthcare facilities, social
services, and resources) [20,22].
In addition to being interrelated and inﬂuencing each other, the social and physical
environments also are hypothesized to inﬂuence SWB and health issues [23,24]. Hence,
at both the community and the individual levels, it is imperative to measure residential
environmental characteristics. Nevertheless, there has been very little effort towards the
integration of these multi-level SWB factors, with the existing studies focusing on just one
such level [18,24]. Applying a multilevel perspective, this study endeavors to ﬁll in the
knowledge gaps, assessing the factors that inﬂuenced the SWB of the elderly migrants. This
study aimed to identify the determinants of subjective well-being of elderly migrants at
the individual and environmental levels. The manner and the extent to which the SWB of
elderly migrants is inﬂuenced by residential environments was the speciﬁc focus of this
study. Our ﬁndings will provide useful information to help policy-makers devise suitable
strategies to improve the SWB of elderly migrants in China by making appropriate changes
to their residential environments.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design and Setting
Between December 2018 and December 2019, a community-based questionnaire survey
was conducted in Dongguan, an industrial city in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau
Greater Bay, in South China. The Dongguan area was identiﬁed for two speciﬁc reasons for
this study. First, the largest migrant population of China resided in Dongguan. Second,
regarding the cultural and its socio-demographic background, the migrant population of
Dongguan was found to be heterogeneous in nature [25,26].
2.2. Participants
Participants included elderly migrants who had come at least six months prior to the
study and were not listed in the Dongguan household registration system. This study
deﬁned an elderly person as aged 60 or more years. The eligible list of elderly migrants
for this study was provided by the community committee. To identify the participants,
a multi-stage cluster sampling survey technique was applied. In the ﬁrst stage, 4 out of
33 districts were purposively selected (Songshan Lake, Dalang, Liaobu, and Dalingshan),
each having more than 75 percent elderly in the population and all located within 30 km of
Guangdong Medical University. In the second stage, 22 clusters, which included 20 migrant
elders in each cluster, were randomly selected from 26 communities with a probability
proportional to the elderly population density. After excluding 11 communities due to
low population density, 15 communities were selected. In the third stage, within each
cluster, migrant elderly participants were selected randomly. Finally, 470 elderly migrants
participated in this study.
2.3. Measurements
2.3.1. Subjective Well-Being (SWB)
SWB was assessed by the Memorial University of Newfoundland Scale of Happiness
(MUNSH), which was designed speciﬁcally for older adults, and which has high validity
(Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin of 0.703) and consistency (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.735). The MUNSH is
a multi-item scale which has 24 items, with total scores ranging between −24 and +24 points,
and where higher scores indicate better SWB [27].
2.3.2. Residential Environment
Both the social and the physical environmental factors were measured. The walkability
and the distances (< 1 km or ≥1 km) from the residence of the participant to healthcare
facilities (such as hospitals, health centers, clinics, and nursing homes) and ﬁnancial facili-
ties (such as post ofﬁce and banks) were included in the study of the physical environment.
Google Maps® was used to measure the distances from the participant’s home to each
of the closest abovementioned facilities in kilometers. Participants were asked whether
they had seen other people in their neighborhood walking around, if there was enough
green space and walking area, and if there were sufﬁcient opportunities or facilities for
physical activities. Applying a scale Mujahid et al. developed, the walkability of the
neighborhood was determined [28]. A 5-point Likert Scale, from 1 = strongly disagree
to 5 = strongly agree with the statements, was applied in the questionnaire; 0.73 was the
original scale’s Cronbach alpha, with the total score ranged between 7 and 35, where higher
scores indicated better walkability [28].
Social environment included distances (< 1 km or ≥1 km) from home to the closest
culture facilities (cultural centers, libraries) and recreation facilities (elderly activity centers,
parks, and cinemas) and social cohesion. Google Maps® was again used to measure the
distances from the participants’ homes to each of the closest abovementioned facilities
in kilometers. Asking the respondents four questions, including their relationship with
their neighbors and their values such as their inter-personal trust, the good relationship
between members of the community, also known as social cohesion, was determined by
the Neighborhood Relation Scale developed by Mujahid et al. [22,28]. The 5-point Likert

4 of 9
Scale, having responses between 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree with each
statement, was applied in the questionnaire. With the total score ranging between 4 and
20, the Cronbach’s alpha of the original scale was found to be 0.74, where higher scores
indicated better social cohesion [28].
The numbers and details of the recreational, cultural, health, and the financial facilities in
every community were also compiled. The number of recreational/cultural/health/financial
facilities divided by the total area in square kilometers of each community determined the
density of the recreational/cultural/health/ﬁnancial facilities.
2.3.3. Individual Characteristics
We measured individual characteristics including demographic information and health
condition. The demographic characteristics recorded were gender, age, and marital sta-
tus (married or cohabiting vs. other). Details of health conditions such as depressive
symptoms and self-rated health were also compiled. Self-rated health was divided into
3 ordinal categories: “good”, “fair”, and “poor”. Containing twenty questions as per the
recommendations of the World Health Organization to screen depression, the Zung Self-
rating Depression Scale was used to measure the depressive symptoms of the participants,
with scores ranging between 20 and 80. A score higher than 53 indicated possible clinical
depression [29].
2.4. Data Collection
Nine interviewers were trained by an experienced researcher before formally collecting
data. The questionnaires were tested in a pilot study. The structured questionnaire as
mentioned above was used to conduct the personal interviews of all the participants
using their local language at their homes, with each interview lasting around 20–25 min.
The administrative committees from the communities in which the participants resided
provided the information regarding the community.
2.5. Statistical Analysis
For quantifying the effects of the community environment and the individual at-
tributes, the multi-level linear models were found suitable. To account for clustering at the
community level, within the 15 communities (level 2), the individuals (level 1) were nested.
Considering only the clustering by community, the null model (no covariates) was applied
for an estimation of the intercept and residual variance. The following were the equations
for the null model:
Level 1 model (individual level): Yij = β0j + rij
Level 2 model (communities): β0j = γ00 + µ0j
Combined model (ﬁxed model): Yij = γ00 + µ0j+ rij
where Yij is the SWB of the ith person in the jth community, and where rij = random error
associated with ith person in the jth community. β0j is the community-speciﬁc (random)
intercept, where γ00 = the overall mean SWB across all communities; µ0j = a series of
random deviations from the mean SWB or QoL for the community.
The relationship between the community-level and individual-level attributes of
communities with SWB was examined subsequent to the testing of the community-level
variance in the SWB excluding all explanatory variables (Model 1 and Model 2, respectively).
Then, we modeled all individual- and community-level variables simultaneously (Model
3). Two-level linear regression analyses with random intercept models were ﬁtted using
the −2 log likelihood (−2 LL) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) for model selection.
All analyses were done using R version 3.4.2.

3. Results
There was a total of 470 migrant elderly, and the mean age was 67.5 ± 5.5 years. The
ratio of males (47.9%) to females (52.1%) was approximately 1:1, and most were married
or cohabitating (79.8%). Most said they had fair to good health (90.2%). Generally, elderly
migrants lived within 3 km of facilities that provided basic needs such as ﬁnancial and
healthcare facilities as well as cultural and recreational facilities. However, the migrants
lived closer to ﬁnancial and health facilities but further from cultural and recreational
facilities. They had good walkable environments (median score = 28) and social cohesion
(median score = 16). The community-level residential environment determinants, namely,
density of each facility, are also shown in Table 1.

At both the community and individual levels, to assess the determinants of SWB,
multi-level models were applied. The regression models were expanded further to examine
community-level factors inﬂuencing elderly SWB using linear mixed models. The null
model indicated that there was a statistically signiﬁcant variation in SWB across communi-
ties (X2 = 167.23, p < 0.05). A variance of SWB of 26.1% was indicated by the random effect
across communities, with the intra-class correlation coefﬁcient (ICC) being 0.261.

The results of the determining factors and the multi-level analysis on the SWB of the
elderly migrants are displayed in Table 2. Model 1 included all the variables at the individ-
ual level. After adjusting the various covariates, the strongest association with SWB was
found in the case of depression. Compared to those who were depressed, individuals who
were not depressed indicated a higher SWB by 0.732 points. Higher SWB was found to be
signiﬁcantly related to good self-rated health conditions, namely, married/cohabiting, and
old age. Nevertheless, social cohesion, walkable environment, and closeness to recreational
facilities were weakly associated with SWB. There was inclusion of only the community
level variables in Model 2. Whereas the density of ﬁnancial facilities displayed a negative
association (B = −0.044, p < 0.01), the densities of recreation facilities (B = 0.038, p < 0.01)
and of health facilities (B = 0.035, p < 0.01) indicated a positive association with SWB. Both
the community- and individual-level variables were included in Model 3 simultaneously.
Signiﬁcant associations with SWB were illustrated by age, marital status, self-rated health,
depression, distance to closest recreation facility, social cohesion, and density of health facil-
ity, and ﬁnancial facility and recreation facility remained signiﬁcantly associated with SWB
when the other covariates were controlled, except for walkable environment (B = 0.014,
p > 0.05). That this model was capable of explaining better the variation in SWB, compared
to the other two models, was implied by Model 3 indicating a much smaller AIC value.

4. Discussion
This study assessed the associated factors of SWB of elderly migrants in Dongguan city,
one of the most rapidly developing areas of China, using both single-level and multi-level
models. SWB is associated with various factors, ranging from individual to environmental
factors. The results shed light on multi-disciplinary and multi-level factors of SWB, partic-
ularly focusing on the extent to which, and the ways in which, migrant elderly people’s
residential environments inﬂuence their SWB.
This study found that physical and social environments affect the SWB of elderly
migrants. However, environmental factors exert a weaker effect on older adults’ SWB than
individual factors, which is consistent with the quantitative results from the same migrant
elderly cohorts [5], but different from the result from older adults in Shanghai [7]. Health
conditions highly contribute to their SWB, and depression has the strongest association
with SWB. In addition to improving their lives, good health was found to be the most
signiﬁcant prerequisite for SWB in elders, as indicated by earlier studies [5,30]. Older
adults were more likely to report higher levels of SWB when they had a positive attitude
for aging [31]. The study by Kosloski et al. found that depression was associated with
lower SWB in older adults, especially among elderly migrants who were acclimatizing to a
new community [32].
We found that living near recreation facilities and having good social cohesion are
associated with high SWB for elderly migrants. These ﬁndings are consistent with Lin’s
results that an increase in opportunities for leisure activities with other people leads to
positive SWB [33]. Moreover, the neighborhood in which the elders lived had an important
bearing on their SWB, as indicated by the results. Previous studies veriﬁed that a cohesive
neighborhood offers migrants support and alleviates their life stress [33,34]. Our study
also showed that the density of health facilities is positively associated with good SWB,
while the density of ﬁnancial facilities negatively impacts SWB. Thus, the importance of
healthcare to the elderly migrants and their effects on SWB were implied. This could
be related to the idea that health status is strongest factor of SWB among older adults.
Good accessibility to health facilities has a strong effect on SWB, while this outcome is in
consonance with that of the existing literature [7,8]. The overcrowding and noise in areas
with a high density of ﬁnancial facilities explained the negative inﬂuence on the SWB of
elderly persons by the density of the ﬁnancial facilities [35,36]. Most elderly migrants in
this study lived in the city center, which has more ﬁnancial facilities and transportation.
Thus, the ﬁnancial facility-dense areas where migrants live have more noise and industrial
pollution. This result is different from that of a study on older adults in Shanghai, which
showed that good accessibility to ﬁnancial facilities seemed to positively inﬂuence older
adults’ perceptions of personal relationships and affection [7].
Certain limitations of this study need to be noted. First, temporal ambiguity (a concept
where researchers cannot determine whether an exposure preceded an outcome) concerning
causes and effects may be present. Second, memory recall could have been an issue, since
the information obtained from each participant was self-reported. Third, the effects may
not have been interpreted causally, since in the multi-level analysis, contextual effects tend
to be interpreted by the individual averages used as group effects.
Based on the ﬁndings discussed above, the following policy implications are recom-
mended. First, in addition to providing suitable community-based support, the social
services policies need to look into the needs of the elderly migrants. Second, the following
planning strategies are needed: enhancing physical planning approaches (e.g., the public
space of communities), and promoting access to healthcare by planning the service delivery
for the whole community. Third, for promoting mutual help and the interaction between
the local elderly population and the migrants, community events, recreational spaces, and
healthcare centers would be indispensable.

5. Conclusions
This study assessed the determinant of SWB of the migrant elderly, integrating indi-
vidual, community, and environmental factors. The study included both individual- and
community-level variables using a multi-level sampling frame and analysis. By enhancing
their accessibility to healthcare and recreational activities, and promoting social services in
their new homes, the SWB amongst elderly migrants could be enhanced further. To ensure
that the elderly do not undergo undue mental health problems, this study suggests further
evaluation periodically based on how the evidence evolves.
