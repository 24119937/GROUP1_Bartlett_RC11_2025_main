 16 october 2015   housetohome.co.uk/idealhomemagazineshoppInG IDEAs Octobervillanova.co.ukEtta Prints and WeavesF or more than 50 years,H
abitat has been helping the nation create beautiful
contemporary homes with  
its well-curated collection of furniture
and accessories. The majority of th
ec
ompany’s products are designed  by an in-
house team, which has beenheaded up for the past three years  
by creative director Polly Dickens. 
Responsible for not only the design
team, but the graphics and visual-
merchandising teams too, Polly i
sin
volved in everything from workingwith designers on creating products 
to decidin
g how they’re photographed,how they look on the website and h
owth
ey’re presented on the shop foor. Since its launch by Terence Conran
in 1964, H
abitat has become wellkn
own and respected for its innovativemodern style and affordable designer
pieces. P
olly and the teams have justlaunched the a
utumn/winter 2015 range, featuring inspiration fromEighties pop culture and modern-day
Africa to tailored curves and
American mid-century-st
yle pieces. THE W
OMAN BEHIND THE LOOKBorn in Haslemere, Surrey, and
brought up in the surrounding area,
Polly went to local schools before
attending Charterhouse, a
s one of the few girls at the pr
estigious boys’public school. She then went on to
Cambridge where she gained a 
degree in English Literature. 
While s
he was studying there, Polly became very involved with  
the student theatre, designing and
creating costumes for amateur
productions. ‘My interest in textiles
defnitely came out of working in
student theatre,’ she explains. ‘Seeing
the costumes I created on stage was
something I enjoyed very much and 
I even toyed with the idea of taking

eet the creative director at habitat, who is wellpl
aced to continue its legacy of good designPolly Dickensa further degree in theatre design. 
It was another route th
at my life could have taken but didn’t.’
Instead, Polly joined a graduate
training course at Liberty. ‘It was a
fabulous opportunity,’ she says. ‘They
took on six or eight graduates, and 
put them through the business in all
different dep
artments and then, if youwanted, you got a job at the end. So I
became an assistant buyer there and
that was how I started in the industry.’
After a couple of years at Liberty,
Polly was offered a job at The Conran
Shop, where she joined the company
as buying director at a time of
expansion and travelled extensively,
flling containers with tr
easured fnds.Then, after a short stint back at Liberty,

 18 OCTOBER 2015   housetohome.co.uk/idealhomemagazinePolly and her husband Mark Gilbeymoved to America in 2000, where she
worked at Anthropologie for four years.
 ‘I r
eally loved it at Anthropologie,’she says. ‘It was s
uch a greatexperience, a
s I learnt a lot abouttra
ditional craft skills and techniques. I a
lso strayed into design areas thatw
ere out of my natural comfort zone,a
s Anthropologie has a much moredecorative and bohemian style,
whereas Conran and Habitat are clean
and contemporary. They w
ere polesapart, but it was an interesting
opportunit
y to  work in both 
environments.’
c
ArEEr pATHTaking on the 
role at Habitat 
has been a big 
challenge for 
Polly, but one 
she admits to 
being the most 
rewarding of her 
career. ‘Habitat is an exciting and fun
place to work, an
d I’ve still got plentyto a
chieve here,’ she explains. ‘It’s aw
onderful institution that has beenaround all my life. I had a very
forward-
thinking granny who owned one of the earliest Habitat sofas, 
which I remember bouncing on as  
a child. I also remember going to the
store in the King’s Road when I was 
a teenager and being overwhelmed 
by how colourful it was. 
‘
One of my frst Habitat purchaseswas a beautiful red enamel saucepan, 
which I bought before I went off touni
versity and owned for years andyears. Plus my husband Mark was  
a furniture designer at Habitat for
about 12 years, so I’ve known the
company from both a design point  
of view as well as a customer for a long
time. I suppose it’s been a big part of
my life because it’s always represented
the things I love – good design and the
strong use of colour and pattern.’
f
AvOurITE pIEcEsPolly is a
lso passionate abouts
upporting traditional crafts and emphasising what
she refers to as the 
‘hand of the maker’. 
‘At Habitat, we work
with a ran
ge of smallworkshops and
factories in places
s
uch as Thailand,Vietnam and India,
and you can really
see that the products
are a
ll made by hand, especially with the ceramics where
each piece is slightly different,
’ sheexplains. ‘
A lot of them are unique andthat’s really important to me.

reating a home is about having theconfdence to put together a mix that
is personal to you, not necessarily
following a particular look or trend,
but being comfortable enough to let
something evolve and to let new
things in when you see something
wonderful and can’t resist buying it.

ith a love of travelling for both work and pleasure, Polly’s
inspiration comes from a range  
of pl

a store I go to or a colour I see, I’ll
absorb it and it will get spat out

om the kitchen to the frst foor, but this hasm
eant that the kitchen really has become theh
eart of our home,’ says Kiki.Th
e family rented an apartment nearby whileth
e year-long project went ahead. In addition to cr
eating the new layout, the house’s exteriorw
as transformed with smart render, a tiled  r
oof and new terraces, and landscaping in  th
e garden. Gradually, the house that no oneh
ad wanted began to look like hot property. ‘I’
ve been very inspired by our years living  in Antw
erp – the calm and classicism ofBelgi
an design,’ says Kiki. ‘The colours we usedin th
e house are very important to me and I’drath
er wait years for the right piece of furnitureth
an buy something new with a short lifespan.’ K
iki chose an elegant palette of soft green,cr
eam and taupe. ‘These colours work really well with the natural light that comes into theh
ouse and I fnd them so relaxing,’ says Kiki.  ‘I a
lso consulted an interior designer halfwaythr
ough the renovation, who came up withs
ome really good ideas for which colours  I s
hould use on which walls.’Th
e couple may have consulted professionalsto h
elp them complete their project, but the en
d result is wholly personal. ‘Everything inthi
s house has travelled with us as our familyh
as moved from place to place,’ says Kiki. ‘
Some are pieces that I love to collect, like  th
e glassware, and others are objects that arepr
ecious because they’ve been given to me  b
y friends and family, such as the ornaments in th
e living room that were made by mym
other, who is an artist. I tend to examine eachr
oom almost like a painting and try to createh
armony and balance, moving things arounduntil th

Moodboards  decorating ideas1 Choose your base colour Whetherit’
s fooring or a wall, the base colour  will be the largest area of colour in your
room, so place a generous sample of it 
onto your board. Including carpet samples
will help you think about texture
, too.2 
Add an accent tone  A dramatic contrast or an accent just a few tones
 away from your base colour? Use your
moodboard to play with options and 
layer it with swatches of fabric, scraps  
of wallpaper and paint colour charts.
3
 Find the right accessories  These will really set the tone in your  
room – go for ones that share an accent
colour and stick to a single theme
. Don’t mix styles, or your fnished scheme will 
look messy rather than efortlessly eclectic.

cie Franklin bought a tir
ed Sixties house  to r
enovate, they had n
o idea of the enormity of th
e project they were a
bout to take on. What started out as a modestb
ut run-down house would end up boastinghigh-en
d finishes and gadgets. ‘We’d neverta
ckled anything like this, but I like to keepb
usy and I’m always watching TV shows aboutb
uilding and renovating homes,’ says Jordan,w
ho admits his DIY skills are lacking. What  h
e does have, however, is determination and  a thirst f
or knowledge that saw him carryingo
ut meticulous research in order to reinvent th
e couple’s dated house inside and out.FIRS

e building sits on a big corner plot in  a vill
age near Bath. ‘We liked the large g
arden and the unusual shape of the house an
d decided to buy it, despite the amount ofw
ork that needed doing,’ says Stacie. Raising  a m
ortgage on the property took severalm
onths, during which time Jordan undertook a gr
eat deal of research into design options. ‘W

ur first rental property wasn’t suitable,’ saysJ

as for a modern, clean-cut family home thatw
ould suit the site,’ says Jordan. J
on Foulds of WhiteBOX Architects devisedan am
bitious scheme, which added 79sq m toth
e existing property’s footprint and ensuredth
at the main garden area would be maintained.‘I’
d never made a planning application before,an
d the house is in a Conservation Area, butth
e neighbours were all really supportive  an
d the plans were approved first time with just a c
ouple of alterations,’ says Jordan. ‘Wew
ere surprised and pleased, as the house is n
ow completely unrecognisable and looksm
ore like a new build than a renovation.’RUNNING THE PRO
JECT A local buildingc
ompany was employed to undertake the  w
ork, with Jordan project managing the build.Th
e house was stripped out and gutted, withc
oncrete floors downstairs dug up to layun
derfloor heating pipes. New footings werea
lso required for the glass extension. A p
alette of key materials, including whiter
ender and oak boarding, have rejuvenated th
e external appearance of the house. Sectionsof s
late render were chosen to complement th
e grey aluminium windows. The most e
ye-catching feature is the new glass extensionan
d the balcony above it. ‘The curved glass ‘The house is in a Conservation area, but all the n
eighbours were really supportive and the plans werea
pproved frst time with just a couple of alterations’c
aused the most stress,’ says Jordan. ‘The first c
ompany that quoted for the job let usdo
wn, so we had to start again, which held up th
e build for two months.’ Grey roof slatesc
omplete the dramatic transformation. In  a
ll, the build took nine months to complete.HIGH-
SPEC DETAILS Jordan and Stacie w
ere keen to introduce up-to-the-minutetechn

crease the overall load of the building  too much,
’ says Fred. ‘The timber-framed box i
s lightweight, which meant we could use thee
xisting foundations with a bit of remedialw
ork and underpinning to one corner.’ In

a and David Horler’sS
omerset farmhouse was w
ell overdue a face-lift. ‘Thepr
operty needed major work w
hen we moved in 18 years ago, so there wasn’tth
e budget for more than a basic update to theb
athroom until now,’ explains Emma. Th
e L-shaped room was a real challenge:  a
 shower enclosure spanned one end and theb
ath was along the opposite wall, with a lot of un
derused space around it. As a result, ther
oom felt cluttered and messy. ‘It was cold an
d the shower was too big,’ says Emma. T
op of Emma’s wish list was a chic pale-greyan
d cream scheme. She also wanted a largev
anity unit with twin basins and roomy drawers in it for storing towels and cleaning products.U
nderfoor heating and a practical bath ands
hower were also top priorities. ‘The room hadto be lo
w maintenance with a classic look thatw
ouldn’t date,’ says Emma. ‘I wanted the vanityunit to be th
e main feature, but I couldn’t fndth
e right piece at an affordable price. As thew
alls are crooked, too, I realised we’d be betteroff h
aving something purpose built.’ T
o maximise every inch of the room, thel
ayout was swapped around so the showerc
ould slot into the space behind the door. Th
e bath ftted perfectly along the other wall,a
llowing the vanity unit to take centre stage. ‘W
e had to be clever with the layout, but itw
orks well now and there’s masses of storage,’s
ays Emma. ‘And with the new underfoorh
eating, the room feels warm and cosy, too.’ ➺ Bespoke storage  bathroom ideas|

ounters that need to be read by  an en

end automatic meter readings to y
our energy supplier using wirelesstechn
ology. It’s part of a governmentiniti
ative called Smart Energy GB andwill s
pell the end of dreaded ‘estimates’.  ho
W do i get one? Every UKh
ousehold will be offered smart meters– to be s
upplied and ftted for free – by20

alled in some homes, but as then
ationwide roll-out begins in earnest,y
our energy supplier will get in touchto arran
ge a time to ft your meters.Y
ou’ll need to be at home when yourm
eters are ftted, and the power supplyw
ill be turned off for up to 60 minutes.On
ce they’re installed, you’ll be given anIn-H
ome Display, which your engineerwill dem
onstrate. This shows in realtim
e how much energy you’re using,h
ow much it’s costing or – for pre-paym
eters – how much credit you have left. Bec
ause the Display has its ownwir
eless connection to your meters,y
ou don’t need an internet connectionan
d security shouldn’t be a concern. ‘
Smart meters send data directly toy
our energy supplier and, from nexty
ear, this will happen via a secure,dedic
ated network called the DataC
ommunications Company,’ saysCl
aire Maugham, director ofc
ommunications at Smart Energy  GB
. ‘Smart-meter data will never sim
ply be sent over the internet.’R

, it’s more likely that children will stay well 
hydrated. When there
’s hot weather and lots of running 
around outdoors, parents hand out water 
frequently and kids are more lik
ely to ask for  i
t as they notice how thirsty they are. But as  the weather turns cooler
, the days get shorter and we move into autumn, it’
s easy to forget how important it is to drink plenty of water
.Children love to learn and be rewarded, 
and they’re more lik
ely to absorb information if it’
s delivered in a fun way. So Nestlé, manufacturer of Nestlé Pure Life
® still bottled water
, has a few suggestions how to teach them why they need to drink water regularly 
and why it doesn
’t have to be a battle to get kids to choose water over other drinks.
 Ge
t growing As playtime is brought inside during the 
cooler months, set aside a couple of hours 
over half term or at the week
end to try out one of the following activities. A
 great way  to show a child how living things beneft from
 water is by using plants, so get them to paint
 the outside of two fowerpots white
, leave to dry
, then apply a second coat.When this is dry
, your child can draw a sad face on one pot and a happy face on the other
 with a black pen. Put herb plants inside each
 one
, then ask your child to water the happy  pot regularly over a couple of weeks, while
 Teach children the importance of drinking water, w
hile also having fun, with these great activitiesKeep the kids busyK
eep bottles of wa
ter close by w
hen you and  t
he kids are p
laying gamesSpend autumn a
fternoons doing ar
ts and craftsignoring the ‘sad’ pot. Get them to record the results and discuss what they learn.
 Alternatively
, take an empty Nestlé Pure Life water bottle and cut of the bottom third. Sand 
the edges, so they aren
’t sharp. Ask your  child to paint it and glue on eyes and a nose
. W
et a sheet of kitchen roll and push it into the bottom of the bottle
, followed by a damp layer of cotton wool, leaving a gap 
of about 2cm below the top
. Sprinkle mustard and cress seeds on top of the cotton wool, pressing 
down lightly
. Leave in a warm, light place, and wait for the mustard and cress ‘hair’ to grow
.M
ake a reward chartT
o help a child get enough water, get them to mak
e a reward chart. On a piece of paper, draw a grid with seven rows and eight columns.
 W
rite a day of the week at the end of each row and write these categories at the top of 
each column: before school; morning break; 
lunch; during ex
ercise; after-school snack; doing homework; dinner; while reading.  
Next, your child can decorate the chart using 
coloured pens, stick
ers, glitter and decorative tape
. Hang it up, then let them stick on a star whenever they drink at one of these times.  
By doing these activities, your child will be 
hydrated and educated while having fun.

over why kids need t
o drink plenty1
 Water makes up more than half of a child’
s body weight and they need to drink more 
water in relation to their body 
size than adults do
. 2
Research suggests that mild dehydration (1% body weight 
loss) can lead to reductions  
in concentration and mental 
performance
*. Water will hydrate without providing calories and 
risking harm to teeth.
3
Children should have six to eight drinks per day
, which should be water
, milk or fruit/vegetable juices.
4
After playing sports or hanging out in hot weather
, children must replenish the 
fuids lost by sweating, on top 
of their usual daily allowance
